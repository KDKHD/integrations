This malware was found during a recent activity group tracked as REF8747.\"\nauthor:\n  - slug: seth-goodwin\n  - slug: daniel-stepanic\nimage: \"Security Labs Images 29.jpg\"\ncategory:\n  - slug: malware-analysis\n---\n\n## BITSLOTH at a glance\n\nBITSLOTH is a newly discovered Windows backdoor that leverages the Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) as its command-and-control mechanism. BITSLOTH was uncovered during an intrusion within the LATAM region earlier this summer. This malware hasn't been publicly documented to our knowledge and while it’s not clear who’s behind the malware, it has been in development for several years based on tracking distinct versions uploaded to VirusTotal.\n\nThe most current iteration of the backdoor at the time of this publication has 35 handler functions including keylogging and screen capture capabilities. In addition, BITSLOTH contains many different features for discovery, enumeration, and command-line execution. Based on these capabilities, we assess this tool is designed for gathering data from victims.\n\n### Key takeaways\n\n - BITSLOTH is a newly discovered Windows backdoor\n - BITSLOTH uses a built-in Microsoft feature, Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) for command-and-control communication \n - BITSLOTH has numerous command handlers used for discovery/enumeration, execution, and collection purposes\n - The backdoor contains logging functions and strings consistent with the authors being native Chinese speakers\n\n## Discovery\n\nOur team observed BITSLOTH installed on a server environment on June 25th during REF8747, this was an intrusion into the Foreign Ministry of a South American government. The intrusion was traced back to PSEXEC execution on one of the infected endpoints. The attackers used a slew of publicly available tools for most of their operations with the exception of BITSLOTH.\n\n - [RINGQ](https://github.com/T4y1oR/RingQ)\n - [IOX](https://github.com/EddieIvan01/iox)\n - [STOWAWAY](https://github.com/ph4ntonn/Stowaway)\n - [GODPOTATO](https://github.com/BeichenDream/GodPotato)\n - [NOPAC](https://github.com/Ridter/noPac)\n - [MIMIKATZ](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz)\n - [PPLFAULT](https://github.com/gabriellandau/PPLFault)\n - [CERTIFY](https://github.com/GhostPack/Certify)\n\nOne of the primary mechanisms of execution was through a shellcode loading project called RINGQ. In a similar fashion to DONUTLOADER, RINGQ will convert any Windows executable and generate custom shellcode placing it into a file ( main.txt). This shellcode gets decrypted and executed in-memory. This technique is used bypass defenses that rely on hash blocklists or static signatures in some anti-malware products.\n\n![Screenshot of RingQ demo](/assets/images/bits-and-bytes-analyzing-bitsloth/image21.png)\n\nWe observed RINGQ being used to load the IOX port forwarder. Note: The key in the image below is the hex conversion of “whoami”.\n\n![RINGQ loading and executing IOX](/assets/images/bits-and-bytes-analyzing-bitsloth/image13.png)\n\nAdditionally the attackers used the STOWAWAY utility to proxy encrypted traffic over HTTP to their C2 servers. Proxy tools, tunnelers, and redirectors are commonly used during intrusions to conceal the adversary responsible for an intrusion. These tools offer adversaries various features, including the ability to bypass internal network controls, provide terminal interfaces, encryption capabilities as well as file transfer options.\n\n![STOWAWAY proxy usage](/assets/images/bits-and-bytes-analyzing-bitsloth/image19.png)\n\nAfter initial access, the actor moved laterally and dropped BITSLOTH in the form of a DLL (```flengine.dll```) inside the ProgramData directory. The actor then executed the music-making program FL Studio (```fl.exe```). Based on the observed call stack associated with the self-injection alert, we confirmed the threat actor used a traditional side-loading technique using a signed version of [FL Studio](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/75747c8b5b3676abde25a8dd66280908c0d0fc57ef054b88a41673619d3bee28/details). \n\n```\n  c:\\windows\\syswow64\\ntdll.dll!0x770841AC\n  c:\\windows\\syswow64\\ntdll.dll!0x7709D287\n  c:\\windows\\syswow64\\kernelbase.dll!0x76ED435F\n  c:\\windows\\syswow64\\kernelbase.dll!0x76ED42EF\n  Unbacked!0x14EAB23\n  Unbacked!0x14EA8B6\n  c:\\programdata\\pl studio\\flengine.dll!0x74AD2F2E\n  c:\\programdata\\pl studio\\fl.exe!0xDB3985\n  c:\\programdata\\pl studio\\fl.exe!0xDB3E5E\n  c:\\programdata\\pl studio\\fl.exe!0xDB4D3F\n  c:\\windows\\syswow64\\kernel32.dll!0x76B267F9\n  c:\\windows\\syswow64\\ntdll.dll!0x77077F4D\n  c:\\windows\\syswow64\\ntdll.dll!0x77077F1B\n```\n\nThis call stack was generated along with a process injection alert, and enabled researchers to extract an in-memory DLL that was set with Read/Write/Execute(RWX) page protections.\n\n#### BITSLOTH overview\n\nDuring our analysis, we found several older BITSLOTH samples demonstrating a record of development since December 2021. Within this project, the malware developer chose notable terminology– referring to BITSLOTH as the ```Slaver``` component and the command and control server as the ```Master``` component. Below is an example of one of the PDB file paths linked to BITSLOTH that depicts this:\n\n![PDB linked to BITSLOTH sample](/assets/images/bits-and-bytes-analyzing-bitsloth/image7.png)\n\nBITSLOTH employs no obfuscation around control flow or any kind of string encryption.\n\n![BITSLOTH strings](/assets/images/bits-and-bytes-analyzing-bitsloth/image9.png)\n\nBoth older and recent samples contain strings used for logging and debugging purposes. As an example at startup, there is a string referenced in the read-only section (```.rdata```). \n\n![Debugging](/assets/images/bits-and-bytes-analyzing-bitsloth/image24.png) \n\nThis Simplified Chinese wide-character string translates to:\n```Note: There is already a program running, do not run it again…```\n\n![String left by developer](/assets/images/bits-and-bytes-analyzing-bitsloth/image29.png)\n\nThese small snippets contained within BITSLOTH help shed light on the development and prioritization of features, along with what appear to be operator instructions. In the latest version, a new scheduling component was added by the developer to control specific times when BITSLOTH should operate in a victim environment. This is a feature we have observed in other modern malware families such as [EAGERBEE](https://www.elastic.co/security-labs/introducing-the-ref5961-intrusion-set).\n\n![BITSLOTH scheduling component](/assets/images/bits-and-bytes-analyzing-bitsloth/image27.png)\n\n## BITSLOTH code analysis\n\nBITSLOTH is a backdoor with many different capabilities including:\n\n - Running and executing commands\n - Uploading and downloading files\n - Performing enumeration and discovery \n - Collecting sensitive data through keylogging and screen capturing\n\n### Mutex\n\nBITSLOTH uses a hard-coded mutex (```Global\\d5ffff77ff77adad657658```) within each sample to ensure only one instance is running at a time. \n\n![Mutex used by BITSLOTH](/assets/images/bits-and-bytes-analyzing-bitsloth/image6.png)\n\n### Communication\n\nBITSLOTH adopts a traditional client/server architecture, the developer refers to the client as the ```Slaver``` component and the command and control server (C2) as the ```Master``` component. The developer embeds the IP/port of the C2 server in each sample with a front-loaded string (```rrrr_url```). This string acts as a key to identify the C2 configuration in itself while running in memory, this is used when updating the C2 server.\n\nBelow are the configurations in several samples our team has observed, the threat actor configures both internal and external IP ranges.\n\n```\nrrrr_url216.238.121[.]132:8443\nrrrr_url192.168.1[.]125:8443 \nrrrr_url192.168.1[.]124:8443\nrrrr_url45.116.13[.]178:443\n```\n\nOne of the defining features of BITSLOTH is using the [Background Intelligent Transfer Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/bits/background-intelligent-transfer-service-portal) (BITS) for C2. While this feature has been designed to facilitate the network transfer of files between two machines, it’s been [abused](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2019/09/09/backdoor-stealth-falcon-group/) by multiple state-sponsored groups and continues to fly under the radar against organizations. This medium is appealing to adversaries because many organizations still struggle to monitor BITS network traffic and detect unusual BITS jobs.\n\n> Windows has a system administration feature called Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) enabling the download and upload of files to HTTP web servers or SMB shares. The BITS service employs multiple features during the file transfer process such as the ability to pause/resume transfers, handling network interruptions, etc. BITS traffic is usually associated with software updates therefore wrongfully implied as trusted. Many organizations lack visibility into BITS network traffic making this an appealing target.\n\nThe BITS API is exposed through Window’s [Component Object Model](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/com/component-object-model--com--portal) (COM) using the **IBackgroundCopyManager** [interface](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/bits/nn-bits-ibackgroundcopymanager). This interface provides capabilities to create new jobs, enumerate existing jobs in the transfer queue, and access a specific job from a transfer queue.\n\n![Initializing IBackgroundCopyManager interface](/assets/images/bits-and-bytes-analyzing-bitsloth/image12.png)\n\nAfter initialization, BITSLOTH cancels any existing BITS jobs on the victim machine that match the following display names:\n\n - ```WU Client Download```\n - ```WU Client Upload```\n - ```WU Client Upload R```\n\nThese names are used by the developer to blend in and associate the different BITS transfer jobs with their respective BITS [job type](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/bits/ne-bits-bg_job_type). By canceling any existing jobs, this allows the execution of the malware to operate from a clean state.\n\n![Switch statement inside BITSLOTH to process BITS job](/assets/images/bits-and-bytes-analyzing-bitsloth/image17.png)\n\nBelow are the Microsoft definitions matching the type of BITS job:\n\n - **BG_JOB_TYPE_DOWNLOAD** - Specifies that the job downloads files to the client.\n - **BG_JOB_TYPE_UPLOAD** - Specifies that the job uploads a file to the server.\n - **BG_JOB_TYPE_UPLOAD_REPLY** - Specifies that the job uploads a file to the server, and receives a reply file from the server application.\n\nAfter canceling any existing jobs, the MAC address and operating system information are retrieved and placed into global variables. A new thread gets created, configuring the auto-start functionality. Within this thread, a new BITS download job is created with the name (```Microsoft Windows```).\n\n![BITS job creation for auto-start functionality](/assets/images/bits-and-bytes-analyzing-bitsloth/image18.png)\n\nThis download job sets the destination URL to ```http://updater.microsoft[.]com/index.aspx```. While this domain is not routable, BITSLOTH masquerades this BITS job using a benign looking domain as a cover then uses **SetNotifyCmdLine** to execute the malware when the transfer state is changed.\n\n![Setting up BITS persistence via SetNotifyCmdLine](/assets/images/bits-and-bytes-analyzing-bitsloth/image28.png)\n\nInterestingly, this unique toolmark allowed us to pivot to additional samples showing this family has been in circulation for several years. \n \n![VirusTotal relationships from embedded Microsoft URL](/assets/images/bits-and-bytes-analyzing-bitsloth/image4.png)\n\nAt this point, the malware has now been configured with persistence via a BITS job named ```Microsoft Windows```. Below is a screenshot of this job’s configuration showing the notification command line set to the BITSLOTH location (```C:\\ProgramData\\Media\\setup_wm.exe```)\n\n![BITSLOTH persistence job](/assets/images/bits-and-bytes-analyzing-bitsloth/image33.png)\n\nOnce BITSLOTH becomes active, it will start requesting instructions from the C2 server using the ```WU Client Download``` job. This request URL is generated by combining the MAC address with a hard-coded string (```wu.htm```). Below is an example URL:\n\n```\nhttps://192.168.182.130/00-0C-29-0E-29-87/wu.htm\n```\n\nIn response to this request, the malware will then receive a 12-byte structure from the C2 server containing a unique ID for the job, command ID for the handler, and a response token. Throughout these exchanges of file transfers, temporary files from the victim machine are used as placeholders to hold the data being transmitted back and forth, BITSLOTH uses a filename starting with characters (```wm```) appended by random characters.\n\n\n![Data exchange through temporary files](/assets/images/bits-and-bytes-analyzing-bitsloth/image25.png)\n\n### Command functionality\n\nBITSLOTH uses a command handler with 35 functions to process specific actions that should be taken on the victim machine. The malware has the option to be configured with HTTP or HTTPS and uses a hardcoded single byte XOR (```0x2```) to obfuscate the incoming instructions from the C2 server. The outbound requests containing the collected victim data have no additional protections by the malware itself and are sent in plaintext. \n\nIn order to move fast, our team leveraged a helpful Python [implementation](https://github.com/SafeBreach-Labs/SimpleBITSServer) of a BITS server released by [SafeBreach Labs](https://www.safebreach.com/). By setting the C2 IP to our loopback address inside a VM, this allowed us to get introspection on the network traffic. \n\n![BITSLOTH command handler](/assets/images/bits-and-bytes-analyzing-bitsloth/image2.png)\n\nThe handlers all behave in a similar approach performing a primary function then writing the data returned from the handler to a local temporary file. These temporary files then get mapped to a BITS upload job called ```WU Client Upload```. Each handler uses its own string formatting to create a unique destination URL. Each filename at the end of the URL uses a single letter to represent the type of data collected from the host, such as ```P.bin``` for processes or ```S.bin``` for services.\n\n```\nhttp://192.168.182.130/00-0C-29-0E-29-87/IF/P.bin\n```\n\nBelow is an example screenshot showing the process enumeration handler with the string formatting and how this data is then linked to the BITS upload job.\n\n![BITSLOTH handler for running processes](/assets/images/bits-and-bytes-analyzing-bitsloth/image31.png)\n\nThis link to the exfiltrated data can also be observed by viewing the BITS upload job directly. In the screenshots below, we can see the destination URL (C2 server) for the upload and the temporary file (```wm9F0C.tmp```) linked to the job.\n\n![BITS upload job configuration](/assets/images/bits-and-bytes-analyzing-bitsloth/image15.png)\n\nIf we look at the temporary file, we can see the collected process information from the victim host.\n\n![Contents of temporary file holding exfiltrated data](/assets/images/bits-and-bytes-analyzing-bitsloth/image26.png)\n\nSoon after the upload job is created, the data is sent over the network through a BITS_POST request containing the captured data.\n\n![Outbound BITS_POST request](/assets/images/bits-and-bytes-analyzing-bitsloth/image22.png)\n\n### Command handling table\n\n| Command ID | Description |\n| ----- | ----- |\n| 0 | Collect running processes via **WTSEnumerateProcessesW** |\n| 1 | Get Windows services via **EnumServicesStatusW** |\n| 2 | Get system information via ```systeminfo``` command |\n| 3 | Retrieve all top-level Windows via **EnumWindows** |\n| 5 | Collect file listings |\n| 6 | Download file from C2 server |\n| 7 | Upload file to C2 server |\n| 10 | Terminate itself |\n| 11 | Set communication mode to HTTPS |\n| 12 | Set communication mode to HTTP |\n| 13 | Remove persistence |\n| 14 | Reconfigure persistence |\n| 15 | Cancel BITS download job (```WU Client Download```) |\n| 16 | Remove persistence and delete itself |\n| 17 | Thread configuration |\n| 18 | Duplicate of handler #2 |\n| 19 | Delete file based on file path |\n| 20 | Delete folder based on file path |\n| 21 | Starts terminal shell using stdin/stdout redirection |\n| 22 | Resets terminal handler (#21) |\n| 23 | Runs Windows tree command |\n| 24 | Updates BITSLOTH, delete old version |\n| 25 | Shutdown the machine via **ExitWindowsEx** |\n| 26 | Reboot the machine via **ExitWindowsEx** |\n| 27 | Log user off from the machine via **ExitWindowsEx** |\n| 28 | Terminate process based on process identifier (PID) |\n| 29 | Retrieves additional information via ```msinfo32``` command |\n| 30 | Execute individual file via **ShellExecuteW** |\n| 34 | Create new directory via **CreateDirectoryW** |\n| 41 | Upload data to C2 server | \n| 42 | Checks for capture driver via **capGetDriverDescriptionW** |\n| 43 | Take screenshots of victim machine desktop |\n| 44 | Record keystrokes from victim machine |\n| 45 | Stop recording screenshot images |\n| 46 | Stop keylogger functionality |\n\n### Backdoor functionality\n\nBITSLOTH includes a wide range of post-compromise capabilities for an adversary to operate within a victim environment. We will focus on the more significant capabilities by grouping them into different categories.\n\n#### Discovery/enumeration\n\nA portion of the BITSLOTH handlers are focused on retrieving and enumerating data from victim machines. This includes:\n\n - Retrieving process information via **WTSEnumerateProcessesW**\n - Collecting Windows services via **EnumServicesStatusW**\n - Enumerating all top-level Windows via **EnumWindows** with a callback function\n - Retrieving system information via windows utilities such as ```systeminfo``` and ```msinfo32```\n\n![BITSLOTH handler used to collect system information](/assets/images/bits-and-bytes-analyzing-bitsloth/image14.png)\n\nIn many of the handlers, the locale version is configured to ```chs ```(Chinese - Simplified).\n\n![Retrieve Windows information](/assets/images/bits-and-bytes-analyzing-bitsloth/image16.png)\n\nBITSLOTH has a couple custom enumeration functions tied to retrieving file listings and performing directory tree searches. The file listing handler takes a custom parameter from the operator to target specific folder locations of interest:\n\n - **GET_DESKDOP** → **CSIDL_DESKTOPDIRECTORY** (Desktop)\n - **GET_BITBUCKET** -> **CSIDL_BITBUCKET** (Recycle Bin)\n - **GET_PERSONAl** -> **CSIDL_MYDOCUMENTS** (My Documents)\n\n![File listing parameters via BITSLOTH](/assets/images/bits-and-bytes-analyzing-bitsloth/image10.png)\n\nBITSLOTH also has the ability to collect entire directory/file listings on the machine for every file by using the Windows [tree](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/tree) utility. This handler loops across the alphabet for each drive letter where the data is then saved locally in a temporary file named ```aghzyxklg```. \n\n![Tree listing via BITSLOTH](/assets/images/bits-and-bytes-analyzing-bitsloth/image1.png)\n\nThe tree data is then compressed and sent to the C2 server with a .ZIP extension. Below is an example of the collected data. This data can help pinpoint sensitive files or provide more context about the target environment. \n\n![Example of data collected through **GetDirectoryTree** handler](/assets/images/bits-and-bytes-analyzing-bitsloth/image5.png)\n\n#### Collection\n\nIn terms of collection, there are a few handlers used for actively gathering information. These are centered around capturing screenshots from the desktop and performing keylogging functionality.\n\nBITSLOTH implements a lightweight function used to identify capture recording devices, this appears to be a technique to check for a camera using the Windows API (**capGetDriverDescriptionW**). \n\n![Handler that records capture devices](/assets/images/bits-and-bytes-analyzing-bitsloth/image30.png)\n\nBITSLOTH has the ability to take screenshots based on parameters provided by the operator. Input to this function uses a separator (```||```) where the operator provides the number of seconds of the capture interval and the capture count. The images are stored as BMP files with a hard coded name ```ciakfjoab``` and compressed with the DEFLATE algorithm using a ```.ZIP``` archive. These timestamped zipped archives are then sent out to the C2 server.\n\nThe handler leverages common screenshot APIs such as **CreateCompatibleBitmap** and **BitBlt** from ```Gdi32.dll```.\n\n![BITSLOTH screen capture using Windows APIs](/assets/images/bits-and-bytes-analyzing-bitsloth/image32.png)\n\nFor recording keystrokes, BITSLOTH uses traditional techniques by monitoring key presses using **GetAsyncKeyState**/**GetKeyState**. The handler has an argument for the number of seconds to perform the keylogging. This data is also compressed in a ```.ZIP``` file and sent outbound to the C2 server.\n\n![Keylogger functionality inside BITSLOTH](/assets/images/bits-and-bytes-analyzing-bitsloth/image8.png)\n\n#### Execution / Maintenance\n\nBITSLOTH has multiple capabilities around maintenace and file execution as well as standard backdoor functionalities such as:\n\n - Capability to execute files stand-alone via **ShellExecuteW**\n - Windows terminal capability to execute commands and read data back via pipes\n - Create directories, perform reboots, shutdown the machine, terminate processes\n - Perform file upload and download between C2 server\n - Modify BITSLOTH configuration such as communication modes, update C2 URL, turn off keylogging/screenshot features\n\n![BITSLOTH’s CMD terminal](/assets/images/bits-and-bytes-analyzing-bitsloth/image11.png)\n\n## BITSLOTH pivots\n\nBITSLOTH appears to be actively deployed. We identified another BITSLOTH C2 server (```15.235.132[.]67```) using the same port (```8443```) with the same [SSL certificate](https://www.shodan.io/search?query=ssl.cert.serial%3A253c1c0bbf58e1f509fc4468de462ed8872f81d9) used from our intrusion. \n\n![Shodan SSL certificate matches](/assets/images/bits-and-bytes-analyzing-bitsloth/image20.png)\n\nWhile it’s not exactly clear who’s behind BITSLOTH, there was a large amount of activity of VirusTotal uploads occurring on December 12, 2021. With around 67 uploads over 24 hours from one submitter (```1fcc35ea```), we suspect someone linked to this project was validating detections, making modifications, and uploading different versions of BITSLOTH to VirusTotal. One sample was packed with VMProtect, others stripped of functionality, some uploads were debug builds, etc.\n\n![BITSLOTH - VirusTotal Submitter (```1fcc35ea```)](/assets/images/bits-and-bytes-analyzing-bitsloth/image23.png)\n\nA lot of time has passed since then, but it is interesting seeing this family show up in a recent intrusion. Whatever the objective behind this malware, it's surprising that this family remained under the radar for so many years.\n\n![Different PDB paths from BITSLOTH uploads](/assets/images/bits-and-bytes-analyzing-bitsloth/image3.png)\n\n### REF 8747 through MITRE ATT&CK\n\nElastic uses the [MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/) framework to document common tactics, techniques, and procedures that advanced persistent threats use against enterprise networks.\n\n[h4] Tactics\nTactics represent the why of a technique or sub-technique.
