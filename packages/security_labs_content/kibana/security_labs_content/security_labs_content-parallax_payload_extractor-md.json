From the directory this README is in, you can build a local container.\n\n```\ndocker build . -t parallax_loader_payload_extractor\n```\n\nThen we run the container with the -v flag to map a host directory to the docker container directory.\n\n```\ndocker run -ti --rm -v $(pwd)/data:/data parallax_loader_payload_extractor:latest --help\n```\n\n### Running it locally\n\nAs mentioned above, Docker is the recommended approach to running this project, however you can also run this locally. This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to manage dependencies, testing, and metadata. If you have Poetry installed already, from this directory, you can simply run the following commands to run the tool. This will setup a virtual environment, install the dependencies, activate the virtual environment, and run the console script.\n\n```\npoetry lock\npoetry install\npoetry shell\nparallax_loader_payload_extractor --help\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nWe can either specify a single sample with **-f** option or a directory of samples with **-d**. You can use the -o switch to set the output directory of the payloads.\n\n```\ndocker run -ti --rm -v $(pwd)/data:/data parallax_loader_payload_extractor:latest -d /data -o /data\n```\n\n![PARALLAX payload extractor](/assets/images/parallax-payload-extractor/image41.jpg)\n\nYou can collect the extracted payloads from the directory you set when running the extractor, the data directory in the root of the extractor in the above example.\n"
