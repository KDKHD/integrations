In this article, you’ll learn more about REMCOS configuration structure and its C2 commands.\n\n## The configuration\n\nIn this section, we provide a comprehensive overview of the configuration fields of the malware.\n\n### Configuration Table\n\nResearchers successfully recovered approximately 80% of the configuration structure (45 out of 56 fields). We provide detailed configuration information in the following table:\n\n\n| Index | Name | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 0x0 | c2_list | String containing “domain:port:enable_tls“ separated by the “\\x1e” character |\n| 0x1 | botnet | Name of the botnet |\n| 0x2 | connect_interval | Interval in second between connection attempt to C2 |\n| 0x3 | enable_install_flag | Install REMCOS on the machine host |\n| 0x4 | enable_hkcu_run_persistence_flag | Enable setup of the persistence in the registry |\n| 0x5 | enable_hklm_run_persistence_flag | Enable setup of the persistence in the registry |\n| 0x7 | keylogger_maximum_file_size | Maximum size of the keylogging data before rotation |\n| 0x8 | enable_hklm_policies_explorer_run_flag | Enable setup of the persistence in the registry |\n| 0x9 | install_parent_directory |  Parent directory of the install folder.

Furthermore, we provide additional details for a select subset of commands.\n\n### Command table\n\nResearchers recovered approximately 95% of the commands (74 out of 78). We provide information about the commands in the following table:\n\n| Function | Name |\n| --- | --- |\n| 0x1 | HeartBeat |\n| 0x2 | DisableKeepAlive |\n| 0x3 | ListInstalledApplications |\n| 0x6 | ListRunningProcesses |\n| 0x7 | TerminateProcess |\n| 0x8 | ListProcessesWindows |\n| 0x9 | CloseWindow |\n| 0xA | ShowWindowMaximized |\n| 0xB | ShowWindowRestore |\n| 0xC | TerminateProcessByWindowHandleAndListProcessesWindows |\n| 0xD | ExecuteShellCmd |\n| 0xE | StartPipedShell |\n| 0xF | ExecuteProgram |\n| 0x10 | MaybeUploadScreenshots |\n| 0x11 | GetHostGeolocation |\n| 0x12 | GetOfflineKeyloggerInformation |\n| 0x13 | StartOnlineKeylogger |\n| 0x14 | StopOnlineKeylogger |\n| 0x15 | MaybeSetKeyloggerNameAndUploadData |\n| 0x16 | UploadKeyloggerData |\n| 0x17 | DeleteKeyloggerDataThenUploadIfAnythingNewInbetween |\n| 0x18 | CleanBrowsersCookiesAndLogins |\n| 0x1B | StartWebcamModule |\n| 0x1C | StopWebcamModule |\n| 0x1D | EnableAudioCapture |\n| 0x1E | DisableAudioCapture |\n| 0x1F | StealPasswords |\n| 0x20 | DeleteFile |\n| 0x21 | TerminateSelfAndWatchdog |\n| 0x22 | Uninstall |\n| 0x23 | Restart |\n| 0x24 | UpdateFromURL |\n| 0x25 | UpdateFromC2 |\n| 0x26 | MessageBox |\n| 0x27 | ShutdownOrHibernateHost |\n| 0x28 | UploadClipboardData |\n| 0x29 | SetClipboardToSpecificData |\n| 0x2A | EmptyClipboardThenUploadIfAnythingInbetween |\n| 0x2B | LoadDllFromC2 |\n| 0x2C | LoadDllFromURL |\n| 0x2D | StartFunFuncModule |\n| 0x2F | EditRegistry |\n| 0x30 | StartChatModule |\n| 0x31 | SetBotnetName |\n| 0x32 | StartProxyModule |\n| 0x34 | ManageService |\n| 0x8F | SearchFile |\n| 0x92 | SetWallpaperFromC2 |\n| 0x94 | SetWindowTextThenListProcessesWindow |\n| 0x97 | UploadDataFromDXDiag |\n| 0x98 | FileManager |\n| 0x99 | ListUploadScreenshots |\n| 0x9A | DumpBrowserHistoryUsingNirsoft |\n| 0x9E | TriggerAlarmWav |\n| 0x9F | EnableAlarmOnC2Disconnect |\n| 0xA0 | DisableAlarmOnC2Disconnect |\n| 0xA2 | DownloadAlarmWavFromC2AndOptPlayIt |\n| 0xA3 | AudioPlayer |\n| 0xAB | ElevateProcess |\n| 0xAC | EnableLoggingConsole |\n| 0xAD | ShowWindow |\n| 0xAE | HideWindow |\n| 0xB2 | ShellExecuteOrInjectPEFromC2OrURL |\n| 0xC5 | RegistrySetHlightValue |\n| 0xC6 | UploadBrowsersCookiesAndPasswords |\n| 0xC8 | SuspendProcess |\n| 0xC9 | ResumeProcess |\n| 0xCA | ReadFile |\n| 0xCB | WriteFile |\n| 0xCC | StartOfflineKeylogger |\n| 0xCD | StopOfflineKeylogger |\n| 0xCE | ListProcessesTCPandUDPTables |\n\n### ListInstalledApplications command\n\nTo list installed applications, REMCOS iterates over the ```Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Uninstall``` registry key. For each subkey, it queries the following values:\n\n - ```DisplayName```\n - ```Publisher```\n - ```DisplayVersion```\n - ```InstallLocation```\n - ```InstallDate```\n - ```UninstallString```\n\n![```0x41C68F``` REMCOS listing installed applications](/assets/images/dissecting-remcos-rat-part-three/image61.png)\n\n\n### ExecuteShellCmd command\nShell commands are executed using the ShellExecuteW API with ```cmd.exe /C {command}``` as arguments.\n\n![Executing a shell command using ```ShellExecuteW``` with ```cmd.exe```](/assets/images/dissecting-remcos-rat-part-three/image19.png)\n\n\n### GetHostGeolocation command\nTo obtain host geolocation, REMCOS utilizes the [geoplugin.net](http://geoplugin.net) API and directly uploads the returned JSON data.\n\n![Requesting geolocation information from geoplugin.net](/assets/images/dissecting-remcos-rat-part-three/image91.png)\n\n\n### StartOnlineKeylogger command\n\nThe online keylogger employs the same keylogger structure as the offline version. However, instead of writing the data to the disk, the data is sent live to the C2.\n\n![```0x40AEEE``` Initialization of the online keylogger](/assets/images/dissecting-remcos-rat-part-three/image23.png)\n\n\n### StartWebcamModule command\n\nREMCOS uses an external module for webcam recording. This module is a DLL that must be received and loaded from its C2 as part of the command parameters.\n\n![```0x404582``` REMCOS loading the webcam module from C2](/assets/images/dissecting-remcos-rat-part-three/image93.png)\n\n\n\nOnce the module is loaded, you can send a sub-command to capture and upload a webcam picture.\n\n![```0x4044F5``` Sub-command handler for capturing and uploading pictures](/assets/images/dissecting-remcos-rat-part-three/image52.png)\n\n\n### StealPasswords command\n\nPassword stealing is likely carried out using 3 different [Nirsoft](https://www.nirsoft.net/) binaries, identified by the \"/sext\" parameters. These binaries are received from the C2 and injected into a freshly created process. Both elements are part of the command parameters.\n\n![```0x412BAA``` REMCOS injects one of the Nirsoft binary into a freshly created process](/assets/images/dissecting-remcos-rat-part-three/image72.png)\n\n\nThe ```/sext``` parameter instructs the software to write the output to a file, each output filename is randomly generated and stored in the malware installation folder. Once their contents are read and uploaded to the C2, they are deleted.\n\n![```0x412B12``` Building random filename for the Nirsoft output file](/assets/images/dissecting-remcos-rat-part-three/image87.png)\n\n\n![Read and delete the output file](/assets/images/dissecting-remcos-rat-part-three/image98.png)\n\n\nAn additional DLL, with a [FoxMailRecovery](https://github.com/jacobsoo/FoxmailRecovery) export, can also be utilized. Like the other binaries, the DLL is received from the C2 as part of the command parameters. As the name implies the DLLis likely to be used to dump FoxMail data\n\n![Loading additional dll with FoxMailRecovery export](/assets/images/dissecting-remcos-rat-part-three/image17.png)\n\n\n### Uninstall command\n\nThe uninstall command will delete all Remcos-related files and persistence registry keys from the host machine.\n\nFirst, it kills the watchdog process.\n![```0x040D0A0``` Killing the watchdog process](/assets/images/dissecting-remcos-rat-part-three/image38.png)\n\n\nThen, it deletes all the recording files (keylogging, screenshots, and audio recordings).\n\n![```0x40D0A5``` Deleting * recording files](/assets/images/dissecting-remcos-rat-part-three/image88.png)\n\n\nThen, it deletes its registry persistence keys.\n\n![```0x40D0EC``` Deleting * persistence keys](/assets/images/dissecting-remcos-rat-part-three/image47.png)\n\n\nFinally, it deletes its installation files by creating and executing a Visual Basic script in the %TEMP% folder with a random filename, then terminates its process.\n\n![```0x40D412``` Executing the delete visual basic script and exit](/assets/images/dissecting-remcos-rat-part-three/image75.png)\n\n\nBelow the generated script with comments.\n\n```\n' Continue execution even if an error occurs\nOn Error Resume Next\n\n' Create a FileSystemObject\nSet fso = CreateObject(\"Scripting.FileSystemObject\")\n\n' Loop while the specified file exists\nwhile fso.FileExists(\"C:\\Users\\Cyril\\Desktop\\corpus\\0af76f2897158bf752b5ee258053215a6de198e8910458c02282c2d4d284add5.exe\")\n\n' Delete the specified file\nfso.DeleteFile \"C:\\Users\\Cyril\\Desktop\\corpus\\0af76f2897158bf752b5ee258053215a6de198e8910458c02282c2d4d284add5.exe\"\n\n' End of the loop\nwend\n\n' Delete the script itself\nfso.DeleteFile(Wscript.ScriptFullName)\n```\n\n### Restart command\n\nThe Restart command kills the watchdog process and restarts the REMCOS binary using a generated Visual Basic script.\n\nBelow is the generated script with comments.\n\n```\n' Create a WScript.Shell object and run a command in the command prompt\n' The command runs the specified .exe file\n' The \"0\" argument means the command prompt window will not be displayed\nCreateObject(\"WScript.Shell\").Run \"cmd /c \"\"C:\\Users\\Cyril\\Desktop\\corpus\\0af76f2897158bf752b5ee258053215a6de198e8910458c02282c2d4d284add5.exe\"\"\", 0\n\n' Create a FileSystemObject and delete the script itself\nCreateObject(\"Scripting.FileSystemObject\").DeleteFile(Wscript.ScriptFullName)\n```\n\n## DumpBrowserHistoryUsingNirsoft command\n\nLike the StealPasswords command, the DumpBrowserHistoryUsingNirsoft command steals browser history using likely another Nirsoft binary received from the C2 as part of the command parameter. Again, we identify the binary as part of Nirsoft because of the ```/stext``` parameter.\n\n![```0x40404C``` Dumping browsers history using likely Nirsoft binary](/assets/images/dissecting-remcos-rat-part-three/image46.png)\n\n\n### ElevateProcess command\n\nThe ElevateProcess command, if the process isn’t already running with administrator privileges, will set the ```HKCU/SOFTWARE/{mutex}/elev``` registry key and restart the malware using the same method as the Restart command.\n\n![```0x416EF6``` Set the ```elev``` registry key and restart](/assets/images/dissecting-remcos-rat-part-three/image26.png)\n\n\nUpon restart, the REMCOS checks the ```elev``` value as part of its initialization phase. If the value exists, it'll delete it and utilize its UAC bypass feature to elevate its privileges.\n\n![```0x40EC39``` Forced UAC bypass if the ```elev``` key exists in the registry](/assets/images/dissecting-remcos-rat-part-three/image95.png)\n\n\nThat’s the end of the third article. In the final part we’ll cover detection and hunt strategies of REMCOS using Elastic technologies.\n"
