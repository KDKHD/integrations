To this end, Elastic Security Labs has compiled the [2022 Global Threat Report](https://www.elastic.co/explore/security-without-limits/global-threat-report) to share trends and tactics adversaries and attack groups use, as observed by our threat research team and broader user community over the past year.\n\nLet’s dig into a few of the endpoint related findings:\n\n1. 72% of all defense evasion techniques consisted of masquerading and system binary proxy execution\n\n2. ~77% of all credential access techniques are attributed to OS credential dumping with commonly known utilities\n\nHere’s a chart on how the endpoint techniques breakdown across our data set.\n\n![](/assets/images/sneak-peek-elastic-2022-global-threat-report/image1.png)\n\nThis was just a preview of the research coming your way. We have lots of findings and recommendations coming your way soon. Stay tuned to [Elastic Security Labs](http://www.elastic.co/security-labs) for the [2022 Elastic Global Threat Report](https://www.elastic.co/explore/security-without-limits/global-threat-report).\n"
