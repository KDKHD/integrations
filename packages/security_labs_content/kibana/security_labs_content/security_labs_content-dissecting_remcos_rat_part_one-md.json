Furthermore, it remains under active development, as evidenced by the [recent announcement](https://breakingsecurity.net/remcos/changelog/) of version 4.9.4's release by the company on March 9, 2024.\n\nAll the samples we analyzed were derived from the same REMCOS 4.9.3 Pro x86 build. The software is coded in C++ with intensive use of the `std::string` class for its string and byte-related operations.\n\nREMCOS is packed with a wide range of functionality, including evasion techniques, privilege escalation, process injection, recording capabilities, etc.\n\nThis article series provides an extensive analysis of the following:\n - Execution and capabilities\n - Detection and hunting strategies using Elastic’s ES|QL queries\n - Recovery of approximately 80% of its configuration fields\n - Recovery of about 90% of its C2 commands\n - Sample virtual addresses under each IDA Pro screenshot\n - And more!\n \n![REMCOS execution diagram](/assets/images/dissecting-remcos-rat-part-one/image77.png)\n\n\nFor any questions or feedback, feel free to reach out to us on social media [@elasticseclabs](https://twitter.com/elasticseclabs) or in the Elastic [Community Slack](https://elasticstack.slack.com).\n\n### Loading the configuration\n\nThe REMCOS configuration is stored in an encrypted blob within a resource named ```SETTINGS```. This name appears consistent across different versions of REMCOS.\n\n![REMCOS config stored in encrypted SETTINGS resource](/assets/images/dissecting-remcos-rat-part-one/image29.png)\n\n\nThe malware begins by loading the encrypted configuration blob from its resource section.\n\n![0x41B4A8 REMCOS loads its encrypted configuration from resources](/assets/images/dissecting-remcos-rat-part-one/image40.png)\n\n\nTo load the encrypted configuration, we use the following Python script and the [Lief](https://pypi.org/project/lief/) module.\n\n```\nimport lief\n\ndef read_encrypted_configuration(path: pathlib.Path) -> bytes | None:\n\tif not (pe := lief.parse(path)):\n    \t\treturn None\n\n\tfor first_level_child in pe.resources.childs:\n    \t\tif first_level_child.id != 10:\n        \t\tcontinue\n\n    \tfor second_level_child in first_level_child.childs:\n        \t\tif second_level_child.name == \"SETTINGS\":\n            \t\t\treturn bytes(second_level_child.childs[0].content)\n```\n\nWe can confirm that version 4.9.3 maintains the same structure and decryption scheme as previously described by [Fortinet researchers](https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/latest-remcos-rat-phishing):\n\n![Fortinet reported structure and decryption scheme](/assets/images/dissecting-remcos-rat-part-one/image55.png)\n\n\nWe refer to the “encrypted configuration” as the structure that contains the decryption key and the encrypted data blob, which appears as follows:\n\n```\nstruct ctf::EncryptedConfiguration\n{\nuint8_t key_size;\nuint8_t key[key_size];\nuint8_t data\n};\n```\n\nThe configuration is still decrypted using the RC4 algorithm, as seen in the following screenshot.\n\n![0x40F3C3 REMCOS decrypts its configuration using RC4](/assets/images/dissecting-remcos-rat-part-one/image53.png)\n\n\nTo decrypt the configuration, we employ the following algorithm.\n\n```\ndef decrypt_encrypted_configuration(\n\tencrypted_configuration: bytes,\n) -> tuple[bytes, bytes]:\n\tkey_size = int.from_bytes(encrypted_configuration[:1], \"little\")\n\tkey = encrypted_configuration[1 : 1 + key_size]\n\treturn key, ARC4.ARC4Cipher(key).decrypt(encrypted_configuration[key_size + 1 :])\n```\n\nThe configuration is used to initialize a global vector that we call ```g_configuration_vector``` by splitting it with the string ```\\x7c\\x1f\\x1e\\x1e\\x7c``` as a delimiter.\n\n![0x40EA16 Configuration string is split to initialize g_configuration_vector](/assets/images/dissecting-remcos-rat-part-one/image48.png)\n\n\nWe provide a detailed explanation of the configuration later in this series.\n\n### UAC Bypass\n\nWhen the ```enable_uac_bypass_flag``` (index ```0x2e```) is enabled in the configuration, REMCOS attempts a UAC bypass using a known COM-based technique.\n\n![0x40EC4C Calling the UAC Bypass feature when enabled in the configuration](/assets/images/dissecting-remcos-rat-part-one/image27.png)\n\n\nBeforehand, the REMCOS masquerades its process in an effort to avoid detection.\n\n![0x40766D UAC Bypass is wrapped between process masquerading and un-masquerading](/assets/images/dissecting-remcos-rat-part-one/image78.png)\n\n\nREMCOS modifies the PEB structure of the current process by replacing the image path and command line with the ```explorer.exe``` string while saving the original information in global variables for later use.\n\n![0x40742E Process PEB image path and command line set to explorer.exe](/assets/images/dissecting-remcos-rat-part-one/image14.png)\n\n\nThe well-known [technique](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1218/003/) exploits the ```CoGetObject``` API to pass the ```Elevation:Administrator!new:``` moniker, along with the ```CMSTPLUA``` CLSID and ```ICMLuaUtil``` IID, to instantiate an elevated COM interface. REMCOS then uses the ```ShellExec()``` method of the interface to launch a new process with administrator privileges, and exit.\n\n![0x407607 calling ShellExec from an elevated COM interface](/assets/images/dissecting-remcos-rat-part-one/image85.png)\n\n\n![0x4074FD instantiating an elevated COM interface](/assets/images/dissecting-remcos-rat-part-one/image9.png)\n\n\nThis technique was previously documented in an Elastic Security Labs article from 2023: [Exploring Windows UAC Bypasses: Techniques and Detection Strategies](https://www.elastic.co/security-labs/exploring-windows-uac-bypasses-techniques-and-detection-strategies).\n\nBelow is a recent screenshot of the detection of this exploit using the Elastic Defend agent.\n\n![UAC bypass exploit detection by the Elastic Defend agent disabling UAC](/assets/images/dissecting-remcos-rat-part-one/image25.png)\n\n\n### Disabling UAC\n\nWhen the ```disable_uac_flag``` is enabled in the configuration (index ```0x27```), REMCOS [disables UAC](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548/002/) in the registry by setting the ```HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\SystemEnableLUA``` value to ```0``` using the ```reg.exe``` Windows binary.\"\n\n![](/assets/images/dissecting-remcos-rat-part-one/image4.png)\n\n\n![](/assets/images/dissecting-remcos-rat-part-one/image12.png)\n\n\n## Install and persistence\n\nWhen ```enable_install_flag``` (index ```0x3```) is activated in the configuration, REMCOS will install itself on the host machine.\n\n![0x40ED8A Calling install feature when the flag is enabled in configuration](/assets/images/dissecting-remcos-rat-part-one/image50.png)\n\n\nThe installation path is constructed using the following configuration values:\n - ```install_parent_directory``` (index ```0x9```)\n - ```install_directory``` (```0x30```)\n - ```install_filename``` (```0xA```)\n\nThe malware binary is copied to ```{install_parent_directory}/{install_directory}/{install_filename}```. In this example, it is ```%ProgramData%\\Remcos\\remcos.exe```.\n\n![Sample detected in its installation directory](/assets/images/dissecting-remcos-rat-part-one/image42.png)\n\n\nIf the ```enable_persistence_directory_and_binary_hiding_flag``` (index ```0xC```) is enabled in the configuration, the install folder and the malware binary are set to super hidden (even if the user enables showing hidden files or folders the file is kept hidden by Windows to protect files with system attributes) and read-only by applying read-only, hidden, and system attributes to them.\n\n![0x40CFC3 REMCOS applies read-only and super hidden attributes to its install folder and files](/assets/images/dissecting-remcos-rat-part-one/image83.png)\n\n\n![Install files set as read-only and super hidden](/assets/images/dissecting-remcos-rat-part-one/image60.png)\n\n\nAfter installation, REMCOS establishes persistence in the registry depending on which of the following flags are enabled in the configuration:\n - ```enable_hkcu_run_persistence_flag``` (index ```0x4```)\n```HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\```\n - ```enable_hklm_run_persistence_flag``` (index ```0x5```)\n```HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\```\n - ```enable_hklm_policies_explorer_run_flag``` (index ```0x8```)\n```HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\Explorer\\Run\\```\n\n![0x40CD0D REMCOS establishing persistence registry keys](/assets/images/dissecting-remcos-rat-part-one/image47.png)\n\n\nThe malware is then relaunched from the installation folder using ```ShellExecuteW```, followed by termination of the initial process.\n\n![0x40D04B Relaunch of the REMCOS process after installation](/assets/images/dissecting-remcos-rat-part-one/image75.png)\n\n\n## Process injection\n\nWhen the ```enable_process_injection_flag``` (index ```0xD```) is enabled in the configuration,  REMCOS injects itself into either a specified or a Windows process chosen from an hardcoded list to evade detection.\n\n![0x40EEB3 Calling process injection feature if enabled in the configuration](/assets/images/dissecting-remcos-rat-part-one/image15.png)\n\n\n![REMCOS running injected into iexplore.exe](/assets/images/dissecting-remcos-rat-part-one/image21.png)\n\n\nThe ```enable_process_injection_flag``` can be either a boolean or the name of a target process. When set to true (1), the injected process is chosen in a “best effort” manner from the following options:\n - ```iexplorer.exe```\n - ```ieinstal.exe```\n - ```ielowutil.exe```\n\n![](/assets/images/dissecting-remcos-rat-part-one/image73.png)\n\n\n*Note: there is only one injection method available in REMCOS, when we talk about process injection we are specifically referring to the method outlined here*\n\nREMCOS uses a classic ```ZwMapViewOfSection``` + ```SetThreadContext``` + ```ResumeThread``` technique for process injection. This involves copying itself into the injected binary via shared memory, mapped using ```ZwMapViewOfSection``` and then hijacking its execution flow to the REMCOS entry point using ```SetThreadContext``` and ```ResumeThread``` methods.\n\nIt starts by creating the target process in suspended mode using the ```CreateProcessW``` API and retrieving its thread context using the ```GetThreadContext``` API.\n\n![0x418217 Creation of target process suspended mode](/assets/images/dissecting-remcos-rat-part-one/image97.png)\n\n\nThen, it creates a shared memory using the ```ZwCreateSection``` API and maps it into the target process using the ```ZwMapViewOfSection``` API, along with the handle to the remote process.\n\n![0x418293 Creating of the shared memory](/assets/images/dissecting-remcos-rat-part-one/image66.png)\n\n\n![0x41834C Mapping of the shared memory in the target process](/assets/images/dissecting-remcos-rat-part-one/image43.png)\n\n\nThe binary is next loaded into the remote process by copying its header and sections into shared memory.\n\n![0x41836F Mapping the PE in the shared memory using ```memmove```](/assets/images/dissecting-remcos-rat-part-one/image90.png)\n\n\nRelocations are applied if necessary. Then, the PEB ```ImageBaseAddress``` is fixed using the ```WriteProcessMemory``` API. Subsequently, the thread context is set with a new entry point pointing to the REMCOS entry point, and process execution resumes.\n\n![0x41840B Hijacking process entry point to REMCOS entry point and resuming the process](/assets/images/dissecting-remcos-rat-part-one/image34.png)\n\n\nBelow is the detection of this process injection technique by our agent:\n\n![Process injection alert](/assets/images/dissecting-remcos-rat-part-one/image54.png)\n\n\n![Process injection process tree](/assets/images/dissecting-remcos-rat-part-one/image59.png)\n\n\n## Setting up logging mode\n\nREMCOS has three logging mode values that can be selected with the ```logging_mode``` (index ```0x28```) field of the configuration:\n - 0: No logging \n - 1: Start minimized in tray icon \n - 2: Console logging\n\n![0x40EFA3 Logging mode configured from settings](/assets/images/dissecting-remcos-rat-part-one/image39.png)\n\n\nSetting this field to 2 enables the console, even when process injection is enabled, and exposes additional information.\n\n![REMCOS console displayed while injected into iexplore.exe](/assets/images/dissecting-remcos-rat-part-one/image71.png)\n\n\n## Cleaning browsers\n\nWhen the ```enable_browser_cleaning_on_startup_flag``` (index ```0x2B```) is enabled,  REMCOS will delete cookies and login information from the installed web browsers on the host. \n\n![0x40F1CC Calling browser cleaning feature when enabled in the configuration](/assets/images/dissecting-remcos-rat-part-one/image5.png)\n\n\nAccording to the [official documentation](https://breakingsecurity.net/wp-content/uploads/dlm_uploads/2018/07/Remcos_Instructions_Manual_rev22.pdf) the goal of this capability is to increase the system security against password theft:\n\n![](/assets/images/dissecting-remcos-rat-part-one/image76.png)\n\n\nCurrently, the supported browsers are Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Chrome.\n\n![0x40C00C Supported browsers for cleaning features](/assets/images/dissecting-remcos-rat-part-one/image7.png)\n\n\nThe cleaning process involves deleting cookies and login files from browsers' known directory paths using the ```FindFirstFileA```, ```FindNextFileA```, and ```DeleteFileA``` APIs:\n\n![0x40BD37 Cleaning Firefox cookies 1/2](/assets/images/dissecting-remcos-rat-part-one/image56.png)\n\n\n![0x40BD37 Cleaning Firefox cookies 2/2](/assets/images/dissecting-remcos-rat-part-one/image74.png)\n\n\nWhen the job is completed, REMCOS prints a message to the console.\n\n![REMCOS printing success message after cleaning browsers](/assets/images/dissecting-remcos-rat-part-one/image96.png)\n\n\nIt's worth mentioning two related fields in the configuration:\n - ```enable_browser_cleaning_only_for_the_first_run_flag``` (index ```0x2C```)\n - ```browser_cleaning_sleep_time_in_minutes``` (index ```0x2D```)\n\nThe ```browser_cleaning_sleep_time_in_minutes``` configuration value determines how much time REMCOS will sleep before performing the job.\n\n![0x40C162 Sleeping before performing browser cleaning job](/assets/images/dissecting-remcos-rat-part-one/image13.png)\n\n\nWhen ```enable_browser_cleaning_only_for_the_first_run_flag``` is enabled, the cleaning will occur only at the first run of REMCOS. Afterward, the ```HKCU/SOFTWARE/{mutex}/FR``` registry value is set.\n\nOn subsequent runs, the function directly returns if the value exists and is set in the registry.\n\n![](/assets/images/dissecting-remcos-rat-part-one/image67.png)\n\n\nThat’s the end of the first article. The second part will cover the second half of REMCOS' execution flow, starting from its watchdog to the first communication with its C2."
