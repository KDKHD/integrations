This activity has managed to stay under the radar with low detection rates and continues to incorporate interesting techniques such as DLL side-loading, syscall adoption, process injection, and leveraging steganography.\n\n[PARALLAX](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.parallax) is a full-featured modal backdoor and loader featuring defense evasion and information on stealing capabilities, first observed in 2020 and associated with COVID-19 malspam campaigns. [NETWIRE](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.netwire) is a mature and cross-platform RAT that was first observed in 2012\n\nIn this research publication, we will go through the execution flow of one of the observed campaigns, the different features of the PARALLAX loader, technical analysis around the campaigns, campaign intersections, detection logic, and atomic indicators.\n\n## Execution Flow (PARALLAX loader)\n\nThe Elastic Security Labs team has been monitoring multiple campaigns over the past year leveraging the [PARALLAX loader](https://blog.morphisec.com/parallax-rat-active-status). PARALLAX has multiple capabilities and use cases. This analysis observed the PARALLAX loader being used to load other remote access tools (the NETWIRE RAT). Using our PARALLAX payload extractor, we have also observed the PARALLAX loader being used to load the PARALLAX RAT for interactive remote access. These infections typically start through email spam campaigns delivering macro-enabled lure documents.\n\n> On July 27, 2022, Microsoft began rolling out a [change to Office documents](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/deployoffice/security/internet-macros-blocked) that will prevent users from opening macros in files that came from the Internet, such as email attachments. We have not observed a change in TTPs based on this update from this intrusion set. Our sampling for this research of macro-enabled Word documents started in March of 2022 and continued through August 2022.\n\nHigh-level summary of the execution flow:\n\n1. An email is sent to a victim with a macro-enabled Microsoft Word document attachment.\n2. The macro downloads malicious files used for DLL-side loading and injection.\n3. The Microsoft developer tool ( **MsiDb.exe** ) sideloads the malicious ( **msi.dll** ).\n4. This malicious DLL drops and decrypts a WAV file ( **cs16.wav** ) before injecting the contents (shellcode) into **cmd.exe**.\n5. The injected shellcode is used to extract the NETWIRE RAT and set up the PARALLAX loader from a dropped image ( **paper.png** ) and inject into **cmd.exe.**\n6. A scheduled task is used to establish persistence for the PARALLAX RAT.\n7. The NETWIRE payload is then executed and sets up its own persistence mechanism.\n\n![Execution flow diagram](/assets/images/exploring-the-ref2731-intrusion-set/image30.png)\n\n### First Stage (lure/macro)\n\nThe first stage in these campaigns involves macro-enabled lure documents typically with themes around United States tax filings.\n\n![Image from lure document walking victim through enabling macros](/assets/images/exploring-the-ref2731-intrusion-set/image9.jpg)\n\nIn this lure, we observed legitimate code lifted from the [GLPK](https://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/) (GNU Linear Programming Kit) used to bypass static analysis of the macro. The malicious code is then interwoven within the macro making it look very genuine and more deceptive.\n\n![Legitimate code from GLPK used in macro](/assets/images/exploring-the-ref2731-intrusion-set/image12.jpg)\n\nThis approach to obfuscation is also observed when critical components used for the next stage are not stored in the macro itself but called from text buried several pages deep within the lure document.\n\n![Download components embedded as text](/assets/images/exploring-the-ref2731-intrusion-set/image1.jpg)\n\nThe macro parses the embedded paragraph text on page three of the lure document and locates the object names and next stage components based on their string length. This is a clever technique to avoid detection based on static analysis of the macro (green text comments added to the images below by ESL for clarity).\n\n![VBA code parsing](/assets/images/exploring-the-ref2731-intrusion-set/image25.jpg)\n\nThe macro then uses the **CreateObject** function to create the required objects and download each of the malware components, saving them to the **AppData** directory of the current user.\n\n![VBA code to create objects](/assets/images/exploring-the-ref2731-intrusion-set/image26.jpg)\n\nIt then executes **AppData\\MsiDb.exe** through the created **wscript.shell** object.\n\nFor this observed lure, the five components that are downloaded for the next stage as identified in the embedded text image above are:\n\n| Filename  | Description                                                                                                                     |\n| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| MsiDb.exe | Legitimate Microsoft development application used to import/export database tables and streams                                  |\n| msi.dll   | Malicious DLL used for side-loading                                                                                             |\n| cs16.wav  | XOR encrypted shellcode                                                                                                         |\n| paper.png | Obfuscated NETWIRE and additional PARALLAX loader stager                                                                        |\n| cs16.cfg  | Configuration containing the location of the next execution stage png file, it can either be local or hosted in a remote server |\n\n### Second Stage (MsiDb.exe)\n\nOne of the key strengths in these campaigns is its ability to bypass static detection by modifying legitimate DLLs, a common trend previously reported with the BLISTER loader analysis [[1](https://www.elastic.co/security-labs/blister-loader), [2](https://www.elastic.co/security-labs/elastic-security-uncovers-blister-malware-campaign)]. Once all the components are retrieved, the macro executes the signed Microsoft development tool ( **MsiDb.exe** ) to load the previously downloaded malicious library ( **msi.dll** ).\n\nWhen the campaign began in September of 2022, this DLL had zero detections in VirusTotal due to its DLL tampering technique where a slight modification of a benign function is overwritten with the second stage.\n\n![0 detection rate on initial upload in VirusTotal](/assets/images/exploring-the-ref2731-intrusion-set/image35.jpg)\n\nWhen ( **MsiDb.exe** ) sideloads the malicious ( **msi.dll** ) module, we can see the difference between the patched and unpatched version of **msi.dll**.\n\n![Comparison between the original and the patched msi.dll function](/assets/images/exploring-the-ref2731-intrusion-set/image36.jpg)\n\nDuring this loading stage, the malicious code is heavily obfuscated and leverages [dynamic API resolution](https://unprotect.it/technique/api-obfuscation/) to bypass static analysis tools and processes. It performs this using two functions:\n\n- One function is used to retrieve library addresses using the CRC32 checksum hash of the requested library name.\n- Another function is used to take the address of the library and the hash of the API name.\n\n![Malicious code performing dynamic API resolution](/assets/images/exploring-the-ref2731-intrusion-set/image21.jpg)\n\nThe malware then builds its own import table, storing it on the stack. An interesting aspect is that the malicious code performs an anti-analysis check to see if the current process name matches the targeted application ( **MsiDb.exe** ), if it doesn’t match, the malware will stop at this stage. This check will hinder automated dynamic analysis systems that might try to analyze **msi.dll** in isolation by executing it with other common applications such as **rundll32.exe** or **regsvr32.exe**.\n\nNext, the malware will load **cs16.wav** and XOR-decrypt it using a key embedded in the file. The key resides in the 200 bytes following the first 4 bytes of the file (bytes 5-204).\n\nThe malware will then execute the shellcode inside the decrypted WAV file.\n\n### Third Stage (shellcode)\n\nTo evade user mode hooks utilized by EDR/AV products and as debugger breakpoints, the malware uses direct system calls to low-level APIs used for process injection. It performs this by first [mapping a file view](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/memory/file-mapping) of the Windows **ntdll.dll** library from the System directory.\n\n![NTDLL mapping](/assets/images/exploring-the-ref2731-intrusion-set/image40.jpg)\n\nIt then retrieves the API offset by subtracting the API address from the loaded base address of the loaded **ntdll.dll** , then finally it will use the offset from the mapped **ntdll.dll** and extract the syscall number.\n\n![Extracting the syscall number](/assets/images/exploring-the-ref2731-intrusion-set/image23.jpg)\n\nAfter this, the loader uses the [Heaven’s Gate technique](https://www.zdnet.com/article/malware-authors-are-still-abusing-the-heavens-gate-technique/) and performs injection in the suspended **cmd.exe** process leveraging native Windows **ZwAllocateVirtualMemory** , **ZwWriteVirtualMemory,** and **ZwResumeThread** API functions.\n\n### Fourth Stage\n\nOne interesting technique observed during this stage is through the use of a dropped file ( **cs16.cfg** ). The file is a legitimate Python header file and is prepended with the next stage file name ( **paper.png** ). In our observations, these point to local files previously downloaded but also has the flexibility to point to hosted objects. This is another example of using benign code to obfuscate more malicious intent.\n\n![Prepending paper.png to cs16.cfg](/assets/images/exploring-the-ref2731-intrusion-set/image20.jpg)\n\nIf the first string of ( **cs16.cfg** ) points to a hosted file, it uses the [**IBackgroundCopyManager**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/bits/nn-bits-ibackgroundcopymanager) Component Object Model (COM) interface to download a PNG file and store it on disk ( **paper.png** in our example).\n\n![Downloading the PNG file using BITS](/assets/images/exploring-the-ref2731-intrusion-set/image38.jpg)\n\nThe malware extracts a configuration structure from the stenographically-obfuscated PNG that contains the next PARALLAX loader stage and the final payload; in our sample, we identified the final payload as the NETWIRE RAT, but this process could be used to deliver other payloads.\n\n![Stenographically obfuscated PNG file](/assets/images/exploring-the-ref2731-intrusion-set/image7.jpg)\n\nThe malware executes position independent shellcode that reads and decodes the PNG file, it first extracts the red pixel bytes to an array by parsing the PNG, then decompresses the data with the [LZMA algorithm](https://www.winzip.com/en/learn/tips/what-is-lzma/).\n\n![Decompressing PNG extracted data](/assets/images/exploring-the-ref2731-intrusion-set/image33.jpg)\n\nNext, it creates a suspended **cmd.exe** process and injects the NETWIRE payload and the last PARALLAX stage that will set up the environment and execute the NETWIRE payload.\n\n![Process tree of the malware’s execution](/assets/images/exploring-the-ref2731-intrusion-set/image19.jpg)\n\nBelow is the memory regions showing the injected process hosting the NETWIRE payload:\n\n![Injected NETWIRE payload in a cmd.exe process](/assets/images/exploring-the-ref2731-intrusion-set/image22.jpg)\n\n### Fifth Stage\n\nThe fifth and final stage of PARALLAX Loader performs a UAC bypass through **CMSTPLUA** COM interface, a technique that has been used by ransomware-like LockBit, it then sets persistence on the system before executing the final payload by creating a scheduled task to run **Msidb.exe** using Component Object Model (COM).\n\n![Scheduled task to run MsiDb.exe](/assets/images/exploring-the-ref2731-intrusion-set/image32.jpg)\n\n## Campaign Analysis\n\nThroughout the analysis of the lure documents and malware families, we observed two campaigns associated with their TTPs, malware, network infrastructure, and lure metadata.\n\nThe intersections we observed allowed us to observe additional network infrastructure and identify the characteristics of one infrastructure owner in Campaign 1.\n\nIn the following sections, we will describe relevant elements and artifacts associated with each campaign, as well as their relationships.\n\nThis section will be focused on campaign intersections. As each campaign functioned similarly with respect to their technical implementation (lure document -\\\\> macro -\\\\> defense evasion techniques -\\\\> PARALLAX loader -\\\\> NETWIRE RAT), we’ll use the analysis of the five stages for the deployment of the PARALLAX and NETWIRE malware that has been described in detail in the previous Execution Flow section.\n\nWhile we are not attributing these campaigns to any specific threat actor, we have identified parallel research leveraging the same TTPs that we observed. This research was attributed to the financially motivated threat group, Evilnum [[1](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0120/), [2](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/actor/evilnum)] and the [DarkCasino campaign](http://blog.nsfocus.net/darkcasino-apt-evilnum/).\n\n### Campaign 1\n\n#### Overview\n\nThis campaign is clustered by shared lure document metadata, network infrastructure, dropped macro, and malicious DLL ( **msi.dll** ) **.**\n\n![Campaign 1 node-link analysis](/assets/images/exploring-the-ref2731-intrusion-set/image28.jpg)\n\n#### Lure Documents\n\nThe three lure documents used in Campaign 1 were all macro-embedded Microsoft Word documents. The documents were all 153 pages long, with the macro embedded on the 3rd page. The documents all included the H1 Word [document header](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/add-a-heading-3eb8b917-56dc-4a17-891a-a026b2c790f2) of **Как я искал Гантмахера** (loosely translated to: “How I searched for Gantmakher”). Vsevolod Gantmakher was a Russian physicist.\n\nExtracting the metadata for all three documents, we can see their relationships based on several fields; most notably:\n\n- The identical **HeadingPairs** (the names of the Word document header).\n- The identical **CreationDate** dates.\n- The identical **LastPrinted** dates.\n- The **ModifyDate** dates are all within 14-minutes.\n\n![Campaign 1 lure document metadata](/assets/images/exploring-the-ref2731-intrusion-set/image17.jpg)\n\nThe H1 document header of the lure documents does not appear relevant to the targeting as the lure document names and lure document content are wholly unrelated: two of the three document names were related to 2021 United States tax filings, all three of the document names are in English, and the contents of the lure documents are in Cyrillic.\n\n#### Macro\n\nThe macro downloads five files, detailed in the Execution Flow section above **(cs16.wav**, **msi.dll** , **MsiDb.exe** , **paper.png** , and **cs16.cfg** ), from a different domain for each lure document.\n\n![Campaign 1 macro-downloaded files](/assets/images/exploring-the-ref2731-intrusion-set/image2.jpg)\n\n#### Network Infrastructure\n\nCampaign 1 included three domains contacted by the macro to download artifacts required for stages two through five (described in the “Execution Flow” section above) and three domains used for the NETWIRE RAT C2.\n\nThe six domains are:\n\n- digitialrotprevention[.]com - macro-connected.\n- internationalmusicservices[.]com - macro-connected.\n- globalartisticservices[.]com - macro-connected.\n- ohioohioa[.]com - NETWIRE C2.\n- ywiyr[.]com - NETWIRE C2.\n- septton[.]com - NETWIRE C2.\n\nThe macro-connected domains (digitialrotprevention[.]com, internationalmusicservices[.]com, and globalartisticservices[.]com) include metadata that has allowed us to cluster these three domains together in Campaign 1.\n\n![Campaign 1 network infrastructure](/assets/images/exploring-the-ref2731-intrusion-set/image29.jpg)\n\nIn the above image, the Admin email address and Admin user name is russnet123@protonmail[.]com and **rus fam** , respectively. As of this writing, these domains have been suspended.\n\n> Our research identified an additional domain, micsupportcenter[.]com that had the same Admin email address and Admin user name. The lure document included similar US tax document themes, macro elements, and TTPs; but we were unable to confirm that it was part of this campaign. This lure document was first observed in May of 2022 and is possibly part of a testing wave, but this is speculation. We are confident this is a malicious domain and are including it as an indicator artifact for this intrusion set, but not this campaign.\n\nOnce the execution flow reaches the Fourth Stage (described in the Execution Flow section above), the final three domains (ohioohioa[.]com, ywiyr[.]com, and septton[.]com) act as ongoing command and control nodes for the NETWIRE RAT.\n\nWhile ​​ohioohioa[.]com and ywiyr[.]com are protected by privacy services, septton[.]com has interesting metadata that we were able to collect and is outlined below in the SEPTTON Domain section below.\n\n#### Campaign 1 Indicators\n\n| Name                                                             | STIX 2.1 Indicator Type | Identifier                                        |\n| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |\n| bc9f19ae835d975de9aaea7d233b6ea9b2bc30f80d192af2e8e68542b588917e | SHA-256                 | Brian_Tax_Docs.doc lure document                  |\n| d70365481fb4806130743afd199697eb981a0eb2756754ecc548f5b30c2203a5 | SHA-256                 | VIRGINIA-TAX-RETURN-2021-US-EXT.doc lure document |\n| 9dd709cb989d985a6cfee4a254f894a3b878a03962dbf253cb09a24ece455d58 | SHA-256                 | All Docs.doc lure document                        |\n| 16227f50bbe42a13a2abf0bf0e146f356863de59525c54909ea8ccc2db448f77 | SHA-256                 | msi.dll PARALLAX loader / NETWIRE                 |\n| 0c8c431a1f589fdcf453c7afada63c2e2e2a887e49abdbb222983fa6044fdf66 | SHA-256                 | cs16.wav (shellcode)                              |\n| 6ed65beb692301af5296ba6751063ae40e91c4e69ced43560c67ce58165c36b5 | SHA-256                 | cs16.cfg (config for PNG stage)                   |\n| 5f259757741757c78bfb9dab2cd558aaa8403951c1495dc86735ca73c33d877f | SHA-256                 | paper.png (stager for NETWIRE)                    |\n| globalartisticservices[.]com                                     | domain-name             | PARALLAX loader domain                            |\n| DigitalRotPrevention[.]com                                       | domain-name             | PARALLAX loader domain                            |\n| InternationalMusicServices[.]com                                 | domain-name             | PARALLAX loader domain                            |\n| russnet123@protonmail[.]com                                      | email-addr              | PARALLAX loader domain registration email address |\n| chisholm.i@aol[.]com                                             | email-addr              | NETWIRE C2 domain registration email address      |\n| ywiry[.]com                                                      | domain-name             | NETWIRE C2 domain                                 |\n| ohioohioa[.]com                                                  | domain-name             | NETWIRE C2 domain                                 |\n| septton[.]com                                                    | domain-name             | NETWIRE C2 domain                                 |\n\n### Campaign 2\n\n#### Overview\n\nThis campaign is clustered through its lure document metadata, network infrastructure, dropped macro, and malicious DLL ( **msvcr100.dll** ).\n\n![Campaign 2 node-link analysis](/assets/images/exploring-the-ref2731-intrusion-set/image24.jpg)\n\n#### Lure Documents\n\nThe lure document used in Campaign 2 is a macro-embedded Microsoft Word document. The document metadata differentiates it from Campaign 1 based on the **LastModifiedBy** field and the macro network infrastructure.\n\n![Campaign 2 lure document metadata](/assets/images/exploring-the-ref2731-intrusion-set/image10.jpg)\n\nThe document name was also related to 2021 United States tax filings.\n\n#### Macro\n\nLike Campaign 1, the macro downloads several files. Beyond the DLL file ( **msvcr100.dll** ), all files were offline before they could be collected. Based on the TTPs observed in this campaign, we assess with high confidence that they **(java.exe**, **Fruit.png** , **idea.cfg** , and **idea.mp3** ) function similarly to the files from Campaign 1 and detailed in the Execution Flow section above.\n\n![Campaign 2 macro-downloaded files](/assets/images/exploring-the-ref2731-intrusion-set/image13.jpg)\n\nAdditional details about the Campaign 1 and Campaign 2 file relationships are in the “Campaign intersections” section below.\n\n#### Network Infrastructure\n\nCampaign 2 included one domain contacted by the macro to download artifacts required for stages two through five (described in detail in the “Execution Flow” section above). Additionally, there was one domain used for the NETWIRE RAT C2.\n\nThe two domains are:\n\n- solro14.s3.ap-northeast-3.amazonaws[.]com - macro-connected\n- ohioohioa[.]com - NETWIRE C2\n\nOnce the execution flow reaches stage four, ohioohioa[.]com acts as the ongoing command and control node for the NETWIRE RAT.\n\n#### Campaign 2 Indicators\n\n| Name                                                             | STIX 2.1 Indicator Type | Identifier                                 |\n| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |\n| solro14.s3.ap-northeast-3.amazonaws[.]com                        | domain-name             | PARALLAX loader domain                     |\n| 32fc0d1ad678133c7ae456ecf66c3fcf97e43abc2fdfce3ad3dce66af4841f35 | SHA-256                 | 2021-Individual-Tax-Form.doc lure document |\n| 443879ee2cb3d572bb928d0831be0771c7120968e442bafe713a6e0f803e8cd9 | SHA-256                 | msvcr100.dll PARALLAX loader / NETWIRE     |\n| ohioohioa[.]com                                                  | domain-name             | NETWIRE C2 domain                          |\n\n## Campaign Intersections\n\nCampaign 1 and Campaign 2 intersect in several ways.\n\nAs illustrated in the image below, each campaign relied on a lure document (or documents) to execute a macro that contacted adversary-owned or controlled domains; downloaded artifacts used to install and protect the PARALLAX and NETWIRE RAT implants. Additionally, in both campaigns we analyzed, there is a shared network infrastructure used for the NETWIRE C2.\n\n![Campaign 1 and Campaign 2 intersections](/assets/images/exploring-the-ref2731-intrusion-set/image16.jpg)\n\n### The Pyramid of Pain\n\nIn 2013 (and updated in 2014), security researcher David Bianco released an analytical model called the [Pyramid of Pain](http://detect-respond.blogspot.com/2013/03/the-pyramid-of-pain.html). The model is intended to understand how uncovering different parts of an intrusion can impact a campaign. As you can see in the model below, the identification of hash values is useful, but easily changed by an adversary whereas identifying TTPs is very difficult for an adversary to change.\n\n![The Pyramid of Pain](/assets/images/exploring-the-ref2731-intrusion-set/image4.jpg)\n\nThe goal of using the Pyramid of Pain is to understand as much about the intrusion as possible and project the impact (read: the amount of \"pain\") you can inflict.\n\nWhen analyzing the two campaigns, we can put the Pyramid of Pain into action.\n\n- **Hash values** - each lure document had a unique hash.\n- **IP addresses** - each network connection leveraged a different IP address.\n- **Domain names** - each network connection leveraged exclusive domains for the macro components but shared a NETWIRE C2 domain (ohioohioa[.]com).\n- **Network/host artifacts**\n\n  - Identically-named host artifacts observed in Campaign 1.\n  - Renamed from Campaign 1, but functionally identical, host artifacts observed in Campaign 2.\n  - Artifact bundles from both campaigns include similarly formatted and functionally identical files.\n\n- **Tools** - macro-enabled Word document lures, and PARALLAX and NETWIRE RATs.\n- **TTPs** - complex and defensive five-staged execution chain.\n\nLooking across both campaigns, we can see there is some shared infrastructure at the Domain Names tier in the NETWIRE C2 domain (ohioohioa[.]com). In the Network/host artifacts tier we can see additional intersections between the campaigns.\n\n![Network/host artifacts](/assets/images/exploring-the-ref2731-intrusion-set/image3.jpg)\n\nIn both campaigns, we can see a PE file ( **MsiDb.exe** and **java.exe** ), a DLL file ( **msi.dll** and **msvcr100.dll** ), a PNG file ( **paper.png** and **Fruit.png** ), an audio-format named file ( **cs16.wav** and **idea.mp3** ), and a configuration file ( **cs16.cfg** and **idea.cfg** ) at the Network/host artifact tier. All downloaded files in Campaign 1 are named the same across all three lure documents. In both campaigns, the audio-format named files have the same base name as the configuration files ( **cs16.wav** / **cs16.cfg** and **idea.mp3** / **idea.cfg** ). In both campaigns, we assess with high confidence that all host artifacts are functionally identical as described in the Execution Flow section above.\n\n## The SEPTTON Domain\n\nAs reported in the Campaign 1 section, most of the network infrastructure was either well-used across multiple intrusions unrelated to our campaigns or protected by domain privacy services.\n\nAn exception to that is the seppton[.]com domain, which was used as the C2 node for a NETWIRE RAT implant in our sampling. Continuing to analyze this domain, we observed several other associated malicious files. While we did not independently verify the family of malware that is communicating with this domain, signature names in VirusTotal include NETWIRE.\n\n> It should be noted that signature names in VirusTotal alone do not present enough information to provide a high-confidence conviction of a malware sample to a malware family.\n\n![septton[.]com file relationships](/assets/images/exploring-the-ref2731-intrusion-set/image5.jpg)\n\nLooking through the registration information for the domain, we observed two elements of note, both email addresses - marketforce666@yandex[.]com and chisholm.i@aol[.]com.\n\n![septton[.]com domain registration](/assets/images/exploring-the-ref2731-intrusion-set/image37.jpg)\n\nIn the next two sections, we’ll discuss the resource development for domains used in campaigns.\n\n### marketforce666\n\nSearching for **marketforce666** in a search engine did not return results of value from the United States; however, when changing to an Internet egress point within Russia and using the Yandex search engine (Yandex is a Russian Internet services provider), we identified 802 results that show this term has been associated with multiple abuse reports.\n\n![marketforce666 Yandex search engine results](/assets/images/exploring-the-ref2731-intrusion-set/image18.jpg)\n\nWhen expanding our search for domains registered by marketforce666@yandex[.]com, we identified three additional domains. We did not observe these additional domains in our campaigns, but we are including them as indicator artifacts. Below are the four total domains (one from Campaign 1 and three additional) that were registered by, either as the admin, tech, or registrant address, marketforce666@yandex[.]com.\n\n![Domains registered to marketforce666@yandex[.]com](/assets/images/exploring-the-ref2731-intrusion-set/image31.jpg)\n\n### gaza666\n\nLooking at the other email address, chisholm.i@aol[.]com, we were able to connect this email address with a moniker of **gaza666** from the online forum and marketplace, Infected Zone.\n\nOn this forum, the user **gaza666** attempted to purchase (`https://infected-zone[.]com/threads/2814/`) an “Office 365 Complete Package” from the online seller **rzkyo**. **gaza666** and the seller **rzkyo** engaged in a dispute on the forum where **gaza666** did not believe they received what they purchased - which was a package for email spamming and four United States Office 365 accounts but received three nonfunctional and non-Office 365 Phillipino accounts. The seller, **rzkyo** , responded and the two debated what was purchased and what was delivered. The dispute was responded to by a moderator who attempted to resolve the issue.\n\n![Invoice email where gaza666 purchased infrastructure from rzkyo](/assets/images/exploring-the-ref2731-intrusion-set/image15.png)\n\n![Invoice where gaza666 is linked to chisholm.i@aol[.]com](/assets/images/exploring-the-ref2731-intrusion-set/image14.png)\n\nThe results of the dispute were not in the forum, but there were several screenshots where **rzkyo** showed **gaza666** and the moderators that the services they sold were functional.\n\n![SMTP credentials from rzkyo to gaza666](/assets/images/exploring-the-ref2731-intrusion-set/image27.png)\n\n![Setup of online SMTP testing service](/assets/images/exploring-the-ref2731-intrusion-set/image34.png)\n\n![Test from email spam accounts purchased from rzkyo](/assets/images/exploring-the-ref2731-intrusion-set/image11.png)\n\nWhile it is unknown if the infrastructure above that **gaza666** attempted to purchase from **rzkyo** was used in our observed campaigns (or ever used at all), but **gaza666** is associated with chisholm.i@aol[.]com, which was used to register septton[.]com, and septton[.]com was used as a NETWIRE C2 node in Campaign 1.\n\n![gaza666 involvement in NETWIRE C2 in Campaign 1](/assets/images/exploring-the-ref2731-intrusion-set/image39.jpg)\n\n**marketforce666** (marketforce666@yandex[.]com) and **gaza666** (chisholm.i@aol[.]com) share a relationship in that both emails were used in the registration of septton[.]com, which was used as a NETWIRE C2 domain for Campaign 1. The **666** term appended to **marketforce** and **gaza** could be another indicator of their relationship, but this could not be confirmed.\n\n## Diamond Model\n\nElastic Security utilizes the [Diamond Model](https://www.activeresponse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/diamond.pdf) to describe high-level relationships between adversaries and victims of intrusions.\n\n![REF2731 diamond model](/assets/images/exploring-the-ref2731-intrusion-set/image8.png)\n\n## Observed Adversary Tactics and Techniques\n\nElastic uses the MITRE ATT&CK framework to document common tactics, techniques, and procedures that advanced persistent threats use against enterprise networks.\n\n### Tactics\n\nTactics represent the why of a technique or sub-technique. It is the adversary’s tactical goal: the reason for performing an action.\n\n- [Resource Development](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0042/)\n- [Initial Access](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0001/)\n- [Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0002/)\n- [Persistence](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0003/)\n- [Privilege Escalation](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0004/)\n- [Defense Evasion](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0004/)\n- [Command and Control](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0011/)\n\n### Techniques / Sub techniques\n\nTechniques and Sub techniques represent how an adversary achieves a tactical goal by performing an action.\n\n- [Acquire Infrastructure: Domains](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583/001/)\n- [Phishing: Attachment](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/001/)\n- [Hijack Execution Flow: DLL Side-Loading](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/002/)\n- [Process Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/)\n- [Scheduled Task](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053/005/)\n- [Native API](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1106/)\n- [Obfuscated Files or Information: Steganography](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/003/)\n- [Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism: Bypass User Account Control](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548/002/)\n\n## Detection\n\n### Detection Logic\n\nThe following detection rules and behavior prevention events were observed throughout the analysis of this intrusion set.\n\n**Behavioral Rules**\n\n- [NetWire RAT Registry Modification](https://github.com/elastic/protections-artifacts/blob/main/behavior/rules/command_and_control_netwire_rat_registry_modification.toml)\n- [Remcos RAT Registry or File Modification](https://github.com/elastic/protections-artifacts/blob/main/behavior/rules/command_and_control_remcos_rat_registry_or_file_modification.toml)\n\n**Detection Rules**\n\n- [Persistence via Scheduled Job Creation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/current/persistence-via-scheduled-job-creation.html)\n- [Command Prompt Network Connection](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/current/command-prompt-network-connection.html)\n\n**Signatures**\n\n- [Windows.Trojan.Parallax](https://github.com/elastic/protections-artifacts/blob/main/yara/rules/Windows_Trojan_Parallax.yar)\n- [Windows.Trojan.Netwire](https://github.com/elastic/protections-artifacts/blob/main/yara/rules/Windows_Trojan_Netwire.yar)\n- [Windows.Trojan.Remcos](https://github.com/elastic/protections-artifacts/blob/main/yara/rules/Windows_Trojan_Remcos.yar)\n\n### YARA\n\nElastic Security has created YARA rules to identify this activity.\n\n```\nrule Windows_Trojan_Parallax_1 {\n    meta:\n        author = “Elastic Security”\n        creation_date = \"2022-09-05\"\n        last_modified = \"2022-09-15\"\n        license = “Elastic License v2”\n        os = \"Windows\"\n        arch = \"x86\"\n        category_type = \"Trojan\"\n        family = \"Parallax\"\n        threat_name = \"Windows.Trojan.Parallax\"\n    strings:\n        $COM_png = { B9 01 00 00 00 6B D1 00 C6 44 15 D4 83 B8 01 00 00 00 C1 E0 00 C6 44 05 D4 B6 B9 01 00 00 00 D1 E1 C6 44 0D D4 33 BA 01 00 00 00 6B C2 03 C6 44 05 D4 28 B9 01 00 00 00 C1 E1 02 C6 44 0D D4 36 BA 01 00 00 00 6B C2 05 C6 44 05 D4 6B B9 01 00 00 00 6B D1 06 C6 44 15 D4 90 B8 01 00 00 00 6B C8 07 C6 44 0D D4 97 }\n        $png_parse = { 8B 4D ?? 8B 04 B8 85 C9 74 ?? 8B F1 90 8A 08 8D 40 ?? 88 0C 1A 42 83 EE ?? 75 ?? 8B 4D ?? 8B 45 ?? 47 3B 7D ?? 72 ?? }\n        $config_func = { C7 45 F8 68 74 74 70 8B ?? ?? 8B 02 89 ?? ?? 6A 08 8D ?? ?? 51 E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 83 C4 08 8B ?? ?? 52 8D ?? ?? 50 8B ?? ?? 8B 51 0C FF D2 }\n        $winnet_function = { B8 77 00 00 00 66 89 ?? ??

The payload extractor documentation and binary download can be accessed [here](https://www.elastic.co/security-labs/parallax-payload-extractor).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn the above research, we have analyzed the two campaigns that we’ve tracked using macro-embedded lure documents that download seemingly benign artifacts from the staging hosts on the Internet, and weaponize those artifacts to perform persistence, command and control, and remote access of an infected host.\n\nWe also highlighted the elements used to cluster the two campaigns together and how the campaigns can be used with analytical models to impose costs on the campaign owners.\n\n## References\n\nThe following were referenced throughout the above research:\n\n-
