From the directory this README is in, you can build a local container.\n\n```\ndocker build . -t emotet-config-extractor\n```\n\nThen we run the container with the **-v** flag to map a host directory to the docker container directory.\n\n```\ndocker run -ti --rm -v $(pwd)/data:/data emotet-config-extractor:latest --help\n```\n\n### Running it locally\n\nAs mentioned above, Docker is the recommended approach to running this project, however you can also run this locally. This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to manage dependencies, testing, and metadata. If you have Poetry installed already, from this directory, you can simply run the following commands to run the tool. This will setup a virtual environment, install the dependencies, activate the virtual environment, and run the console script.\n\n```\npoetry lock\npoetry install\npoetry shell\nemotet-config-extractor --help\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nAll samples need to be unpacked prior to execution extraction attempts.\n\nOur extractor takes either a directory of samples with **-d** option or **-f** for a single sample and then can output parts of the configuration of note, specifically:\n\n- **-k** : extract the encryption keys\n- **-c** : extract the C2 information\n- **-s** : extract the wide-character strings\n- **-a** : extract the ASCII character strings\n\n```\ndocker run -ti --rm -v $(pwd)/data:/data emotet-config-extractor:latest -d \"C:\\tmp\\samples\"\n```\n\n![EMOTET configuration extractor](/assets/images/emotet-configuration-extractor/image.jpg)\n\nYou can collect the extracted configurations from the directory you set when running the extractor.\n"
