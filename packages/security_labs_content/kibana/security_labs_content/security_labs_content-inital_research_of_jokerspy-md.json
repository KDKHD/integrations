While this detection in itself was not necessarily innocuous, the industry vertical and additional activity we observed following these initial alerts caught our eye and caused us to pay closer attention.\n\nFollowing the execution of **xcc** , we observed the threat actor attempting to bypass TCC permissions by creating their own TCC database and trying to replace the existing one. On June 1st a new Python-based tool was seen executing from the same directory as **xcc** and was utilized to execute an open-source macOS post-exploitation enumeration tool known as Swiftbelt.\n\n## Analysis\n\nREF9134 is an intrusion into a large Japan-based cryptocurrency service provider focusing on asset exchange for trading Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other common cryptocurrencies.\n\n### The xcc binary\n\n**xcc** ( **d895075057e491b34b0f8c0392b44e43ade425d19eaaacea6ef8c5c9bd3487d8** ) is a self-signed multi-architecture binary written in Swift which is used to evaluate current system permissions. The version observed by Elastic Security Labs is signed as **XProtectCheck-55554944f74096a836b73310bd55d97d1dff5cd4** , and has a code signature resembling [publicly known](https://objective-see.org/blog/blog_0x73.html) and untrusted payloads.\n\n![Initial detection of the xcc binary](/assets/images/inital-research-of-jokerspy/image8.png)\n\nTo identify other binaries signed with the same identifier, we converted **XProtectCheck-55554944f74096a836b73310bd55d97d1dff5cd4** to hexadecimal and searched VirusTotal to identify 3 additional samples ( **content:\\{5850726f74656374436865636b2d35353535343934346637343039366138333662373333313062643535643937643164666635636434\\}** ).\n\nEach contained the same core functionality with structural differences. These discrepancies may indicate that these variants of **xcc** were developed to bypass endpoint capabilities that interfered with execution.\n\nShortly after the creation of **xcc** , researchers observed the threat actor copying **/Users/Shared/tcc.db** over the existing TCC database, **/Library/Application Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db**. This may enable the threat to avoid TCC prompts visible to system users while simultaneously abusing a directory with broad file write permissions.\n\n#### XCode artifacts\n\nDuring analysis of this binary, researchers identified two unique paths, **/Users/joker/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/** and **/Users/joker/Downloads/Spy/XProtectCheck/XProtectCheck/** , which stood out as anomalous. The default path for compiling code with Xcode is **/Users/[username]/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData**.\n\n#### Abusing TCC\n\nThese introspection permissions are managed by the native Transparency, Consent, and Control (TCC) feature. Researchers determined that **xcc** checks FullDiskAccess and ScreenRecording permissions, as well as checking if the screen is currently locked and if the current process is a trusted accessibility client.\n\n![xcc queries current system permissions](/assets/images/inital-research-of-jokerspy/image2.jpg)\n\nUpon successfully executing in our [Detonate](https://www.elastic.co/security-labs/click-click-boom-automating-protections-testing-with-detonate) environment, the following results were displayed:\n\n![TCC permissions queried by xcc](/assets/images/inital-research-of-jokerspy/image3.jpg)\n\nOnce the custom TCC database was placed in the expected location, the threat actor executed the **xcc** binary.\n\n![Threat actor creating/modifying, moving a TCC database, and then executing xcc](/assets/images/inital-research-of-jokerspy/image4.jpg)\n\n#### Initial access\n\nThe **xcc** binary was executed via bash by three separate processes\n\n- **/Applications/IntelliJ IDEA.app/Contents/MacOS/idea**\n- **/Applications/iTerm.app/Contents/MacOS/iTerm2**\n- **/Applications/Visual Studio Code.app/Contents/MacOS/Electron.**\n\nWhile we are still investigating and continuing to gather information, we strongly believe that the initial access for this malware was a malicious or backdoored plugin or 3rd party dependency that provided the threat actor access. This aligns with the connection that was made by the researchers at [Bitdefender](https://www.bitdefender.com/blog/labs/fragments-of-cross-platform-backdoor-hint-at-larger-mac-os-attack/) who correlated the hardcoded domain found in a version of the **sh.py** backdoor to a Tweet about an infected macOS QR code reader which was found to have a malicious dependency.\n\n#### Deployed cryptographic libraries\n\nOn May 31st, researchers observed three non-native [DyLibs](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/DynamicLibraries/100-Articles/UsingDynamicLibraries.html) deployed to **/Users/shared/keybag/** called **libcrypto.1.0.0.dylib** , **libncursesw.5.dylib** , and **libssl.1.0.0.dylib**. On MacOS, keys for file and keychain Data Protection are stored in [keybags](https://support.apple.com/en-au/guide/security/sec6483d5760/web), and pertain to iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, and tvOS. At this time, researchers propose that this staging serves a defense evasion purpose and speculate that they may contain useful vulnerabilities. The threat actor may plan to introduce these vulnerabilities to otherwise patched systems or applications.\n\n#### The sh.py backdoor\n\n**sh.py** is a Python backdoor used to deploy and execute other post-exploitation capabilities like Swiftbelt **.**\n\nThe malware loads its configuration from **~/Public/Safari/sar.dat**. The configuration file contains crucial elements such as command-and-control (C2) URLs, a sleep timer for beaconing purposes (the default value is 5 seconds), and a unique nine-digit identifier assigned to each agent.\n\n![Execution of sh.py with the C2 URL provided as a parameter](/assets/images/inital-research-of-jokerspy/image5.jpg)\n\nAs part of its periodic beaconing, the malware gathers and transmits various system information. The information sent includes:\n\n- Hostname\n- Username\n- Domain name\n- Current directory\n- The absolute path of the executable binary\n- OS version\n- Is 64-bit OS\n- Is 64-bit process\n- Python version\n\nBelow is a table outlining the various commands that can be handled by the backdoor:\n\n| Command | Description                                                                           |\n| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| sk      | Stop the backdoor's execution                                                         |\n| l       | List the files of the path provided as parameter                                      |\n| c       | Execute and return the output of a shell command                                      |\n| cd      | Change directory and return the new path                                              |\n| xs      | Execute a Python code given as a parameter in the current context                     |\n| xsi     | Decode a Base64-encoded Python code given as a parameter, compile it, then execute it |\n| r       | Remove a file or directory from the system                                            |\n| e       | Execute a file from the system with or without parameter                              |\n| u       | Upload a file to the infected system                                                  |\n| d       | Download a file from the infected system                                              |\n| g       | Get the current malware's configuration stored in the configuration file              |\n| w       | Override the malware's configuration file with new values                             |\n\n### Swiftbelt\n\nOn June 1st, the compromised system registered a signature alert for [MacOS.Hacktool.Swiftbelt](https://github.com/elastic/protections-artifacts/blob/main/yara/rules/MacOS_Hacktool_Swiftbelt.yar), a MacOS enumeration capability inspired by [SeatBelt](https://github.com/GhostPack/Seatbelt) and created by the red-teamer Cedric Owens. Unlike other enumeration methods, Swiftbelt invokes Swift code to avoid creating command line artifacts. Notably, **xcc** variants are also written using Swift.\n\nThe signature alert indicated that Swiftbelt was written to **/Users/shared/sb** and executed using the bash shell interpreter, **sh**. The full command line observed by researchers was **Users/Shared/sb /bin/sh -c /users/shared/sb \\\\> /users/shared/sb.log 2\\\\>&1** , demonstrating that the threat actor captured results in **sb.log** while errors were directed to STDOUT.\n\n## Diamond Model\n\nElastic Security utilizes the [Diamond Model](https://www.activeresponse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/diamond.pdf) to describe high-level relationships between the adversaries, capabilities, infrastructure, and victims of intrusions. While the Diamond Model is most commonly used with single intrusions, and leveraging Activity Threading (section 8) as a way to create relationships between incidents, an adversary-centered (section 7.1.4) approach allows for a, although cluttered, single diamond.\n\n![REF9134 Diamond Model](/assets/images/inital-research-of-jokerspy/image1.png)\n\n## Observed tactics and techniques\n\n### MITRE ATT&CK Tactics\n\nTactics represent the why of a technique or sub-technique. It is the adversary’s tactical goal: the reason for performing an action.
