There is no doubt this security implementation has raised the bar and directly impacted the malware ecosystem. After months with this new feature, many infostealers have written new code to bypass this protection (as the Chrome Security Team predicted) in order to stay competitive in the market and deliver capabilities that reliably retrieve cookie data from Chrome browsers.\n\nElastic Security Labs has been tracking a subset of this activity, identifying multiple techniques used by different malware families to circumvent App-Bound Encryption. While the ecosystem is still evolving in light of this pressure, our goal is to share technical details that help organizations understand and defend against these techniques. In this article, we will cover the different methods used by the following infostealer families:\n\n - STEALC/VIDAR\n - METASTEALER\n - PHEMEDRONE\n - XENOSTEALER\n - LUMMA\n\n# Key takeaways\n\n - Latest versions of infostealers implement bypasses around Google’s recent cookie protection feature using Application-Bound Encryption\n - Techniques include integrating offensive security tool ChromeKatz, leveraging COM to interact with Chrome services and decrypt the app-bound encryption key, and using the remote debugging feature within Chrome\n - Defenders should actively monitor for different cookie bypass techniques against Chrome on Windows in anticipation of future mitigations and bypasses likely to emerge in the near- to mid-term\n - Elastic Security provides mitigations through memory signatures, behavioral rules, and hunting opportunities to enable faster identification and response to infostealer activity\n\n# Background\n\nGenerically speaking, cookies are used by web applications to store visitor information in the browser the visitor uses to access that web app. This information helps the web app track that user, their preferences, and other information from location to location– even across devices.\n\nThe authentication token is one use of the client-side data storage structures that enables much of how modern web interactivity works. These tokens are stored by the browser after the user has successfully authenticated with a web application. After username and password, after multifactor authentication (MFA) via one-time passcodes or biometrics, the web application “remembers” your browser is you via the exchange of this token with each subsequent web request.\n\nA malicious actor who gets access to a valid authentication token can reuse it to impersonate the user to that web service with the ability to take over accounts, steal personal or financial information, or perform other actions as that user such as transfer financial assets.\n\nCybercriminals use infostealers to steal and commoditize this type of information for their financial gain.\n\n## Google Chrome Cookie Security\n\nLegacy versions of Google Chrome on Windows used the Windows native [Data Protection API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/security/how-to-use-data-protection) (DPAPI) to encrypt cookies and protect them from other user contexts. This provided adequate protection against several attack scenarios, but any malicious software running in the targeted user’s context could decrypt these cookies using the DPAPI methods directly. Unfortunately, this context is exactly the niche that infostealers often find themselves in after social engineering for initial access. The DPAPI scheme is now [well known to attackers](https://posts.specterops.io/operational-guidance-for-offensive-user-dpapi-abuse-1fb7fac8b107) with several attack vectors; from local decryption using the API, to stealing the masterkey and decrypting remotely, to abusing the domain-wide backup DPAPI key in an enterprise environment.\n\nWith the release of Chrome 127 in July 2024, Google [implemented](https://developer.chrome.com/release-notes/127) Application-Bound Encryption of browser data. This mechanism directly addressed many common DPAPI attacks against Windows Chrome browser data–including cookies. It does this by storing the data in encrypted datafiles, and using a service running as SYSTEM to verify any decryption attempts are coming from the Chrome process before returning the key to that process for decryption of the stored data.\n\n![Chrome 127 Application-Bound Encryption Scheme. Source: https://security.googleblog.com/2024/07/improving-security-of-chrome-cookies-on.html](/assets/images/katz-and-mouse-game/image5.png)\n\n\n\nWhile it is our view that this encryption scheme is not a panacea to protect all browser data (as the Chrome Security Team acknowledges in their release) we do feel it has been successful in driving malware authors to TTPs that are more overtly malicious, and easier for defenders to identify and respond to.\n\n# Stealer Bypass Techniques, Summarized\n\nThe following sections will describe specific infostealer techniques used to bypass Google’s App-Bound Encryption feature as observed by Elastic. Although this isn’t an exhaustive compilation of bypasses, and development of these families is ongoing, they represent an interesting dynamic within the infostealer space showing how malware developers responded to Google’s recently updated security control. The techniques observed by our team include:\n\n - Remote debugging via Chrome’s DevTools Protocol\n - Reading process memory of Chrome network service process (ChromeKatz and ```ReadProcessMemory``` (RPM))\n - Elevating to ```SYSTEM``` then decrypting ```app_bound_encryption_key``` with the ```DecryptData``` method of ```GoogleChromeElevationService``` through COM\n\n![Timeline of events](/assets/images/katz-and-mouse-game/image30.png)\n\n## STEALC/VIDAR\n\nOur team observed new code introduced to STEALC/VIDAR related to the cookie bypass technique around September 20th. These were atypical samples that stood out from previous versions and were implemented as embedded 64-bit PE files along with conditional checks. Encrypted values in the SQLite databases where Chrome stores its data are now prefixed with v20, indicating that the values are now encrypted using application-bound encryption.\n\n> [STEALC](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.stealc) was introduced in 2023 and was developed with “heavy inspiration” from other more established stealers such as [RACOON](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.raccoon) and [VIDAR](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.vidar). STEALC and VIDAR have continued concurrent development, and in the case of App-Bound Encryption bypasses have settled on the same implementation.\n\nDuring the extraction of encrypted data from the databases the malware checks for this prefix. If it begins with ```v20```, a child process is spawned using the embedded PE file in the ```.data``` section of the binary. This program is responsible for extracting unencrypted cookie values residing in one of Chrome's child processes. \n\n![Embedded PE file](/assets/images/katz-and-mouse-game/image2.png)\n\nThis embedded binary creates a hidden desktop via ```OpenDesktopA``` / ```CreateDesktopA``` then uses ```CreateToolhelp32Snapshot``` to scan and terminate all ```chrome.exe``` processes. A new ```chrome.exe``` process is then started with the new desktop object. Based on the installed version of Chrome, the malware selects a signature pattern for the Chromium feature [CookieMonster](https://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/network-stack/cookiemonster/), an internal component used to manage cookies.\n\n![Signature pattern for ```CookieMonster```](/assets/images/katz-and-mouse-game/image38.png)\n\nWe used the [signature patterns](https://github.com/Meckazin/ChromeKatz/blob/9152004174e9a0b2d092c70ebc75efbf80fa1098/CookieKatz/Main.cpp#L123) to pivot to existing code developed for an offensive security tool called [ChromeKatz](https://github.com/Meckazin/ChromeKatz). At this time, the patterns have been removed from the ChromeKatz repository and replaced with a new technique. Based on our analysis, the malware author appears to have reimplemented ChromeKatz within STEALC in order to bypass the app-bound encryption protection feature. \n\nOnce the malware identifies a matching signature, it enumerates Chrome’s child processes to check for the presence of the ```--utility-sub-type=network.mojom.NetworkService``` command-line flag. This flag indicates that the process is the network service responsible for handling all internet communication. It becomes a prime target as it holds the sensitive data the attacker seeks, as described in MDSec’s [post](https://www.mdsec.co.uk/2021/01/breaking-the-browser-a-tale-of-ipc-credentials-and-backdoors/). It then returns a handle for that specific child process. \n\n![Enumerating for Chrome’s network service](/assets/images/katz-and-mouse-game/image37.png)\n\nNext, it enumerates each module in the network service child process to find and retrieve the base address and size of ```chrome.dll``` loaded into memory. STEALC uses [```CredentialKatz::FindDllPattern```](https://github.com/Meckazin/ChromeKatz/blob/767047dcf8f53c70be5e3e0859c5eee3f129d758/CredentialKatz/Memory.cpp#L280) and [```CookieKatz::FindPattern```](https://github.com/Meckazin/ChromeKatz/blob/767047dcf8f53c70be5e3e0859c5eee3f129d758/CookieKatz/Memory.cpp#L435) to locate the CookieMonster instances. There are 2 calls to ```CredentialKatz::FindDllPattern```.\n\n![Calls to ```CredentialKatz::FindDllPattern```](/assets/images/katz-and-mouse-game/image17.png)\n\nIn the first call to ```CredentialKatz::FindDllPattern```, it tries to locate one of the signature patterns (depending on the victim’s Chrome version) in ```chrome.dll```. Once found, STEALC now has a reference pointer to that memory location where the byte sequence begins which is the function ```net::CookieMonster::~CookieMonster```, destructor of the ```CookieMonster``` class.\n\n![Byte sequence for ```net::CookieMonster::~CookieMonster``` found in ```chrome.dll```](/assets/images/katz-and-mouse-game/image14.png)\n\nThe second call to ```CredentialKatz::FindDllPattern``` passes in the function address for ```net::CookieMonster::~CookieMonster(void)``` as an argument for the byte sequence search, resulting in STEALC having a pointer to ```CookieMonster```’s Virtual Function Pointer struct.\n\n![```CookieMonster```’s vtable in ```chrome.dll```](/assets/images/katz-and-mouse-game/image19.png)\n\nThe following method used by STEALC is again, identical to ChromeKatz, where it locates ```CookieMonster``` instances by scanning memory chunks in the ```chrome.dll``` module for pointers referencing the ```CookieMonster``` vtable. Since the vtable is a constant across all objects of a given class, any ```CookieMonster``` object will have the same vtable pointer. When a match is identified, STEALC treats the memory location as a ```CookieMonster``` instance and stores its address in an array.\n\n![Using ```CookieKatz::FindPattern``` to locate ```CookieMonster``` instances](/assets/images/katz-and-mouse-game/image16.png)\n\nFor each identified ```CookieMonster``` instance, STEALC accesses the internal ```CookieMap``` structure located at an offset of ```+0x30```, and which is a binary tree. Each node within this tree contains pointers to ```CanonicalCookieChrome``` structures. ```CanonicalCookieChrome``` structures hold unencrypted cookie data, making it accessible for extraction. STEALC then initiates a tree traversal by passing the first node into a dedicated traversal function.\n\n![Initiating ```CookieMap``` tree traversal for each ```CookieMonster``` instance found](/assets/images/katz-and-mouse-game/image20.png)\n\nFor each node, it calls ```ReadProcessMemory``` to access the ```CanonicalCookieChrome``` structure from the target process’s memory, then further processing it in ```jy::GenerateExfilString```. \n\n![```CookieMap``` traversal subroutine](/assets/images/katz-and-mouse-game/image31.png)\n\nSTEALC formats the extracted cookie data by converting the expiration date to UNIX format and verifying the presence of the ```HttpOnly``` and ```Secure``` flags. It then appends details such as the cookie's name, value, domain, path, and the ```HttpOnly``` and ```Secure``` into a final string for exfiltration. [```OptimizedString```](https://github.com/Meckazin/ChromeKatz/blob/9152004174e9a0b2d092c70ebc75efbf80fa1098/CookieKatz/Memory.cpp#L10) structs are used in place of strings, so string values can either be the string itself, or if the string length is greater than 23, it will point to the address storing the string. \n\n![Constructing string for data exfiltration](/assets/images/katz-and-mouse-game/image23.png)\n\n## METASTEALER\n\n[METASTEALER](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.metastealer), first observed in 2022, recently upgraded its ability to steal Chrome data, bypassing Google’s latest mitigation efforts. On September 30th, the malware authors announced this update via their Telegram channel, highlighting its enhanced capability to extract sensitive information, including cookies, despite the security changes in Chrome's version ```129+```.\n\n![METASTEALER announcement and translation](/assets/images/katz-and-mouse-game/image26.png)\n\n![source: https://x.com/g0njxa/status/1840761619686568319/](/assets/images/katz-and-mouse-game/image28.png)\n\nThe [first sample](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/973a9056040af402d6f92f436a287ea164fae09c263f80aba0b8d5366ed9957a) observed in the wild by our team was discovered on September 30th, the same day the authors promoted the update. Despite claims that the malware operates without needing ```Administrator``` privileges, our testing revealed it does require elevated access, as it attempts to impersonate the ```SYSTEM``` token during execution.\n\n![Code comparison between an old and a new version of the family](/assets/images/katz-and-mouse-game/image11.png)\n\nAs shown in the screenshots above, the ```get_decryption``` method now includes a new Boolean parameter. This value is set to ```TRUE``` if the encrypted data (cookie) begins with the ```v20``` prefix, indicating that the cookie is encrypted using Chrome's latest encryption method. The updated function retains backward compatibility, still supporting the decryption of cookies from older Chrome versions if present on the infected machine.\n\nThe malware then attempts to access the ```Local State``` or ```LocalPrefs.json``` files located in the Chrome profile directory. Both files are JSON formatted and store encryption keys (```encrypted_key```) for older Chrome versions and ```app_bound_encrypted_key``` for newer ones. If the flag is set to ```TRUE```, the malware specifically uses the ```app_bound_encrypted_key``` to decrypt cookies in line with the updated Chrome encryption method.\n\n![```app_bound_encrypted_key``` extracted from Chrome json file](/assets/images/katz-and-mouse-game/image13.png)\n\nIn this case, the malware first impersonates the ```SYSTEM``` token using a newly introduced class called ```ContextSwitcher```.\n\n![New class for TOKEN impersonation](/assets/images/katz-and-mouse-game/image35.png)\n\nIt then decrypts the key by creating an instance via the COM of the Chrome service responsible for decryption, named ```GoogleChromeElevationService```, using the CLSID ```708860E0-F641-4611-8895-7D867DD3675B```. Once initialized, it invokes the [```DecryptData```](https://github.com/chromium/chromium/blob/225f82f8025e4f93981310fd33daa71dc972bfa9/chrome/elevation_service/elevator.cc#L155) method to decrypt the ```app_bound_encrypted_key``` key which will be used to decrypt the encrypted cookies.\n\n![New class ```ComInvoker``` to invoke methods from ```GoogleChromeElevationService``` service](/assets/images/katz-and-mouse-game/image8.png)\n\nMETASTEALER employs a technique similar to the one demonstrated in a [gist](https://gist.github.com/snovvcrash/caded55a318bbefcb6cc9ee30e82f824) shared [on X](https://x.com/snovvcrash/status/1839715912812802162) on September 27th, which may have served as inspiration for the malware authors. Both approaches leverage similar methods to bypass Chrome's encryption mechanisms and extract sensitive data.\n\n## PHEMEDRONE\n\nThis [open-source stealer](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.phemedrone_stealer) caught the world’s attention earlier in the year through its usage of a Windows SmartScreen vulnerability (CVE-2023-36025). While its development is still occurring on Telegram, our team found a recent [release](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/1067d27007ea862ddd68e90ef68b6d17fa18f9305c09f72bad04d00102a60b8c) (2.3.2) submitted at the end of September including new cookie grabber functionality for Chrome.\n\n![```README.txt``` within PHEMEDRONE project](/assets/images/katz-and-mouse-game/image10.png)\n\nThe malware first enumerates the different profiles within Chrome, then performs a browser check using function (```BrowserHelpers.NewEncryption```) checking for the Chrome browser with a version greater than or equal to ```127```.\n\n![Chrome version verification in PHEMEDRONE](/assets/images/katz-and-mouse-game/image27.png)\n\nIf the condition matches, PHEMEDRONE uses a combination of helper functions to extract the cookies.\n\n![High-level functions used cookie extraction in PHEMEDRONE](/assets/images/katz-and-mouse-game/image34.png)\n\nBy viewing the ```ChromeDevToolsWrapper``` class and its different functions, we can see that PHEMEDRONE sets up a remote debugging session within Chrome to access the cookies. The default port (```9222```) is used along with window-position set to ```-2400```,```-2400``` which is set off-screen preventing any visible window from alerting the victim.\n\n![New Chrome process in remote debug mode](/assets/images/katz-and-mouse-game/image15.png)\n\nNext, the malware establishes a WebSocket connection to Chrome’s debugging interface making a request using deprecated Chrome DevTools Protocol method (```Network.getAllCookies```). \n\n![Chrome DevTools Protocol used to retrieve cookies](/assets/images/katz-and-mouse-game/image24.png)\n\nThe cookies are then returned from the previous request in plaintext, below is a network capture showing this behavior:\n\n![Cookie data within network capture](/assets/images/katz-and-mouse-game/image32.png)\n\n## XENOSTEALER\n\n[XENOSTEALER](https://github.com/moom825/XenoStealer/) is an open-source infostealer hosted on GitHub. It appeared in July 2024 and is under active development at the time of this publication. Notably, the Chrome bypass feature was committed on September 26, 2024.\n\nThe approach taken by XENOSTEALER is similar to that of METASTEALER. It first parses the JSON file under a given Chrome profile to extract the ```app_bound_encrypted_key```. However, the decryption process occurs within a Chrome process. To achieve this, XENOSTEALER launches an instance of ```Chrome.exe```, then injects code using a helper class called [```SharpInjector```](https://github.com/moom825/XenoStealer/blob/d1c7e242183a2c8582c179a1b546f0a5cdff5f75/XenoStealer/Injector/SharpInjector.cs), passing the encrypted key as a parameter.\n\nThe injected code subsequently calls the ```DecryptData``` method from the ```GoogleChromeElevationService``` to obtain the decrypted key.\n\n![Source code of the injected code](/assets/images/katz-and-mouse-game/image29.png) \n\n## LUMMA\n\nIn mid-October, the latest version of [LUMMA](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.lumma) implemented a new method to bypass Chrome cookie protection, as reported by [@g0njxa](https://x.com/g0njxa).\n\n![](/assets/images/katz-and-mouse-game/image40.png)\n\nWe analyzed a recent version of LUMMA, confirming that it managed to successfully recover the cookie data from the latest version of Google Chrome (```130.0.6723.70```). LUMMA first creates a visible Chrome process via ```Kernel32!CreateProcessW```.\n\n![Dump of ```CreateProcessW lpApplicationName``` parameter](/assets/images/katz-and-mouse-game/image3.png)\n\nThis activity was followed up in the debugger with multiple calls to ```NtReadVirtualMemory``` where we identified LUMMA searching within the Chrome process for ```chrome.dll```.\n\n![LUMMA seeks ```chrome.dll``` in Chrome](/assets/images/katz-and-mouse-game/image7.png)\n\nOnce found, the malware copies the ```chrome.dll``` image to its own process memory using ```NtReadVirtualMemory```. In a similar fashion to the ChromeKatz technique, Lumma leverages pattern scanning to target Chrome’s ```CookieMonster``` component. \n\n![Lumma’s pattern scanning](/assets/images/katz-and-mouse-game/image36.png)\n\nLumma uses an obfuscated signature pattern to pinpoint the ```CookieMonster``` functionality:\n\n```\n3Rf5Zn7oFA2a????k4fAsdxx????l8xX5vJnm47AUJ8uXUv2bA0s34S6AfFA????kdamAY3?PdE????6G????L8v6D8MJ4uq????k70a?oAj7a3????????K3smA????maSd?3l4\n```\n\nBelow is the YARA rule after de-obfuscation:\n\n```\nrule lumma_stealer\n{\n  meta:\n    author = \"Elastic Security Labs\"\n  strings:\n    $lumma_pattern = { 56 57 48 83 EC 28 89 D7 48 89 CE E8 ??

As expected, this has caused malware developers to develop or integrate their own bypasses. We hope Google will continue to innovate to provide stronger protection for user data. \n\nOrganizations and defenders should consistently monitor for unusual endpoint activity. While these new techniques may be successful, they are also noisy and detectable with the right security instrumentation, processes, and personnel.  \n\n## Stealer Bypasses and MITRE ATT&CK\n\nElastic uses the [MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/) framework to document common tactics, techniques, and procedures that threats use against enterprise networks.\n\n### Tactics\n\nTactics represent the why of a technique or sub-technique.
