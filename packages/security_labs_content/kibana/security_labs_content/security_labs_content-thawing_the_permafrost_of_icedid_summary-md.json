ICEDID has always been a prevalent family, but has achieved even more growth since EMOTETâ€™s temporary [disruption](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/emotet-botnet-disrupted-international-cyber-operation) in early 2021. ICEDID has been linked to the distribution of other distinct malware families including [DarkVNC](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.darkvnc) and [COBALT STRIKE](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/threat-analysis-report-all-paths-lead-to-cobalt-strike-icedid-emotet-and-qbot). Regular industry reporting, including research publications like this one, help mitigate this threat.\n\nElastic Security Labs analyzed a recent ICEDID variant consisting of a loader and bot payload. By providing this research to the community end-to-end, we hope to raise awareness of the ICEDID execution chain, highlight its capabilities, and deliver insights about how it is designed.\n\n### Execution Chain\n\nICEDID employs multiple stages before establishing persistence via a scheduled task and may retrieve components from C2 dynamically. The following diagram illustrates major phases of the ICEDID execution chain.\n\n![ICEDID attack chain](/assets/images/thawing-the-permafrost-of-icedid-summary/image1.jpg)\n\n### Research Paper Overview\n\nElastic Security Labs described the full execution chain of a recent ICEDID sample in a detailed research [paper](https://www.elastic.co/pdf/elastic-security-labs-thawing-the-permafrost-of-icedid.pdf) hosted at Elastic Security Labs. In addition, we provide a comprehensive analysis of this malware sample and capabilities, including: - Virtualization detection and anti-analysis - C2 polling operations - Shellcode execution methods - Credential access mechanisms - Websocket connections - Installing a web browser proxy to capture all user traffic - Reverse shell and VNC server installation - Certificate pinning - Data validation - ICEDID observable TTPs - Links to useful resources from Elastic\n\n### Detections and preventions\n\n#### Detection logic\n\n- [Enumeration of Administrator Accounts](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/current/enumeration-of-administrator-accounts.html)\n- [Command Shell Activity Started via RunDLL32](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/current/command-shell-activity-started-via-rundll32.html)\n- [Security Software Discovery using WMIC](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/current/security-software-discovery-using-wmic.html)\n- [Suspicious Execution from a Mounted Device](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/current/suspicious-execution-from-a-mounted-device.html)\n- [Windows Network Enumeration](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/current/windows-network-enumeration.html)\n- [Unusual DLL Extension Loaded by Rundll32 or Regsvr32](https://github.com/elastic/protections-artifacts/blob/main/behavior/rules/defense_evasion_unusual_dll_extension_loaded_by_rundll32_or_regsvr32.toml)\n- [Suspicious Windows Script Interpreter Child Process](https://github.com/elastic/protections-artifacts/blob/main/behavior/rules/execution_suspicious_windows_script_interpreter_child_process.toml)\n- [RunDLL32 with Unusual Arguments](https://github.com/elastic/protections-artifacts/blob/main/behavior/rules/defense_evasion_rundll32_with_unusual_arguments.toml)\n\n#### Preventions (source: [https://github.com/elastic/protections-artifacts/](https://github.com/elastic/protections-artifacts/))\n\n- Malicious Behavior Detection Alert: Command Shell Activity\n- Memory Threat Detection Alert: Shellcode Injection\n- Malicious Behavior Detection Alert: Unusual DLL Extension Loaded by Rundll32 or Regsvr32\n- Malicious Behavior Detection Alert: Suspicious Windows Script Interpreter Child Process\n- Malicious Behavior Detection Alert: RunDLL32 with Unusual Arguments\n- Malicious Behavior Detection Alert: Windows Script Execution from Archive File\n\n#### YARA\n\nElastic Security has created multiple YARA rules related to the different stages/components within ICEDID infection, these can be found in the signature linked below: - [Windows.Trojan.ICEDID](https://github.com/elastic/protections-artifacts/blob/main/yara/rules/Windows_Trojan_IcedID.yar)\n\n---\n\nElastic Security Labs is a team of dedicated researchers and security engineers focused on disrupting adversaries though the publication of detailed detection logic, protections, and applied threat research.\n\nFollow us on @elasticseclabs or visit our research portal for more resources and research.\n"
