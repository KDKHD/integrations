This includes machines such as domain controllers/member servers leveraging Active Directory/Kerberos, as these services rely on the Windows DNS service.\n\nOf note, this is an impact on the way Windows DNS server improperly handles malformed requests and not an underlying issue with the DNS protocol itself.\n\nThe SIGRed exploit leverages multiple tactics and techniques categorized by the MITRE ATT&CK® framework:\n\n### Tactics\n\n- [Lateral Movement](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0008)\n- [Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0002)\n\n### Techniques\n\n- [External Remote Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1133)\n- [Exploitation of Remote Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1210)\n\n## Detection\n\n### Detection logic\n\nOn June 30, 2020, The Elastic Security Intelligence & Analytics Team [released](https://www.elastic.co/blog/elastic-security-opens-public-detection-rules-repo) our [Detection Rules Repository](https://github.com/elastic/detection-rules) to the public. Expanding on the rules that were released with that post, we’ve included network and endpoint rules that target CVE-2020-1350 (SIGRed) in the public repository:\n\n- [Unusual Child Process of dns.exe](https://github.com/elastic/detection-rules/blob/main/rules/windows/execution_unusual_dns_service_children.toml)\n- [Unusual File Modification by dns.exe](https://github.com/elastic/detection-rules/blob/main/rules/windows/execution_unusual_dns_service_file_writes.toml)\n- [Abnormally Large DNS Response](https://github.com/elastic/detection-rules/blob/main/rules/windows/lateral_movement_dns_server_overflow.toml)\n\n### Unusual child of dns.exe - Kibana Query Language (KQL)\n\nThe detection logic in Figure 1 (below) identifies suspicious or unexpected child processes spawned from the Windows DNS service (dns.exe). This activity may indicate activity related to remote code execution (RCE) or other forms of exploitation.\n\n```\nevent.category:process and event.type:start and process.parent.name:dns.exe and not process.name:conhost.exe\n```\n\n_Figure 1 - Unusual child process of dns.exe_\n\n### Unusual file operations of dns.exe (KQL)\n\nThe detection logic in Figure 2 (below) identifies suspicious or unexpected files being modified by the Windows DNS service (dns.exe). This not only indicates potential RCE or exploitation, but may also indicate preparation for post-compromise activities. For example, this service which is running with SYSTEM privileges could be used to silently write a DLL to Windows system folder setting up possible execution through a known DLL side-loading vector.\n\n```\nevent.category:file and process.name:dns.exe and not file.name:dns.log\n```\n\n_Figure 2 - Unusual file modification by dns.exe_\n\n### Network (Packetbeat and Filebeat with the Zeek or Suricata modules)\n\nAs detailed in the [Check Point SIGRed research](https://research.checkpoint.com/2020/resolving-your-way-into-domain-admin:-exploiting-a-17-year-old-bug-in-windows-dns-servers/), abnormally large DNS responses can cause the heap-based buffer overflow scenario. The logic in Figure 3 (below) identifies large DNS responses using either Packetbeat or Filebeat (with Zeek or Suricata modules enabled).\n\n```\nevent.category:(network or network_traffic) and destination.port:53 and (event.dataset:zeek.dns or type:dns or event.type:connection) and network.bytes>60000\n```\n\n_Figure 3 - Abnormally large DNS response (KQL)_\n\n![Figure 4 - Packetbeat network detection logic identifying SIGRed - PCAP Source: maxpl0it](/assets/images/detection-rules-for-sigred-vulnerability/packetbeat-network-blog-sigred-vulnerability.png)\n\n![Figure 5 - Filebeat (with Zeek and Suricata) network detection logic identifying SIGRed - PCAP Source: SANS Internet Storm Center](/assets/images/detection-rules-for-sigred-vulnerability/filebeat-network-blog-sigred-vulnerability.png)\n\n## Defensive recommendations\n\n1. Review and [implement](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/siem/guide/7.8/rules-ui-create.html#create-rule-ui) the above detection logic within your environment using technology such as [Endpoint security](https://www.elastic.co/endpoint-security/), [Winlogbeat](https://www.elastic.co/beats/winlogbeat), [Packetbeat](https://www.elastic.co/beats/packetbeat), or [network security monitoring (NSM)](https://www.elastic.co/training/network-security-monitoring-engineer) platforms such as Zeek or Suricata.\n2. Use the included network rule to identify large DNS queries and responses from internal and external populations.\n3. Ensure that you have deployed the latest Microsoft [Security Update](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2020-1350) (Monthly Rollup or Security Only) and restart the patched machines. If unable to patch immediately: Microsoft [released](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4569509/windows-dns-server-remote-code-execution-vulnerability) a registry-based workaround that doesn’t require a restart. This can be used as a temporary solution before the patch is applied.\n4. Maintain backups of your critical systems to aid in quick recovery.\n5. Perform routine vulnerability scans of your systems and patch identified vulnerabilities.\n\n## References\n\n1.
