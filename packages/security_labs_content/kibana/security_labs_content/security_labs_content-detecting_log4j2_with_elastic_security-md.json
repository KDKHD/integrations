This version is accurate as of Tuesday, December 14, 2021. Updates from Apache may be investigated directly via the [security page](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html#) for Log4j2.\n\n## Summary of CVE-2021-44228 (Log4Shell)\n\nLog4j2 is an open source logging framework incorporated into many Java based applications on both end-user systems and servers. In [late November 2021](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html#), Chen Zhaojun of Alibaba identified a remote code execution vulnerability, ultimately being reported under the CVE ID : [CVE-2021-44228](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228), released to the public on December 10, 2021. The vulnerability is exploited through improper deserialization of user-input passed into the framework. It permits remote code execution and it can allow an attacker to leak sensitive data, such as environment variables, or execute malicious software on the target system.\n\nThe identified vulnerability impacts all versions of Log4j2 from version 2.0-beta9 to version 2.14.1. Early methods to patch the issue resulted in a number of release candidates, culminating in recommendations to upgrade the framework to Log4j2 2.15.0-rc2 at the time of this post.\n\nGiven the trivial complexity and the nature of observed widespread exploitation, mitigation should be considered critical in any environment that has identified software leveraging vulnerable versions of Log4j2.\n\n## Detecting Exploitation of Log4Shell in Elastic Security\n\nElastic Security users can use the following Event Correlation detection rule to identify active exploitation of the Log4j2 vulnerability. Depending on the format of the host based event data you may need to modify this detection to match your data fields.\n\n**Detection Rule when using Endpoint data**\n\n```\nsequence by host.id with maxspan=1m\n [network where event.action == \"connection_attempted\" and\n  process.name : \"java\" and\n  /*\n     outbound connection attempt to\n     LDAP, RMI or DNS standard ports\n     by JAVA process\n   */\n  destination.port in (1389, 389, 1099, 53, 5353)] by process.pid\n [process where event.type == \"start\" and\n\n  /* Suspicious JAVA child process */\n  process.parent.name : \"java\" and\n   process.name : (\"sh\",\n                   \"bash\",\n                   \"dash\",\n                   \"ksh\",\n                   \"tcsh\",\n                   \"zsh\",\n                   \"curl\",\n                   \"perl*\",\n                   \"python*\",\n                   \"ruby*\",\n                   \"php*\",\n                   \"wget\")] by process.parent.pid\n```\n\n**Detection Rule when using Auditbeat data**\n\n```\nsequence by agent.id with maxspan=1m\n [network where event.action == \"connected-to\" and\n  process.name : \"java\" and\n  /*\n     outbound connection attempt to\n     LDAP, RMI or DNS standard ports\n     by JAVA process\n   */\n  destination.port in (1389, 389, 1099, 53, 5353)] by process.pid\n [process where event.type == \"start\" and\n\n  /* Suspicious JAVA child process */\n  process.parent.name : \"java\" and\n   process.name : (\"sh\",\n                   \"bash\",\n                   \"dash\",\n                   \"ksh\",\n                   \"tcsh\",\n                   \"zsh\",\n                   \"curl\",\n                   \"perl*\",\n                   \"python*\",\n                   \"ruby*\",\n                   \"php*\",\n                   \"wget\")] by process.parent.pid\n```\n\n**Detection rule when using Endgame streamed events**\n\n```\nsequence by agent.id with maxspan=1m\n [network where event.category == \"network\" and\n  process.name : \"java\" and\n  /*\n     outbound connection attempt to\n     LDAP, RMI or DNS standard ports\n     by JAVA process\n   */\n  destination.port in (1389, 389, 1099, 53, 5353)] by process.pid\n [process where event.type == \"start\" and\n\n  /* Suspicious JAVA child process */\n  process.parent.name : \"java\" and\n   process.name : (\"sh\",\n                   \"bash\",\n                   \"dash\",\n                   \"ksh\",\n                   \"tcsh\",\n                   \"zsh\",\n                   \"curl\",\n                   \"perl*\",\n                   \"python*\",\n                   \"ruby*\",\n                   \"php*\",\n                   \"wget\")] by process.parent.pid\n```\n\nThis detection rule looks for a sequence of an outbound connection attempt to standard ports for LDAP, RMI and DNS (often abused via recently observed [JAVA/JNDI](https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-16/materials/us-16-Munoz-A-Journey-From-JNDI-LDAP-Manipulation-To-RCE.pdf) injection attacks) followed by a child process of the same Java process instance.\n\nNow, letâ€™s demonstrate how this rule detects exploitation of the log42j vulnerability:\n\n![The screenshot above shows an attacker exploiting the vulnerability with a base-64 encoded payload](/assets/images/detecting-log4j2-with-elastic-security/blog-elastic-security-1.jpg)\n\nThe screenshot above shows an attacker exploiting the vulnerability with a base-64 encoded payload targeting an [example vulnerable application](https://github.com/christophetd/log4shell-vulnerable-app) created by [Christophe Tafani-Dereeper](https://github.com/christophetd).\n\n![This screenshot

exploit.](/assets/images/detecting-log4j2-with-elastic-security/blog-elastic-security-2.jpg)\n\nThis screenshot shows the detection of the active exploitation of CVE-2021-44228 within Elastic Security detailing both the alert and timeline view of the exploit.\n\n![The screenshot above shows in the investigation of the detection alert that Java executed a shell script to download and run a bash script.](/assets/images/detecting-log4j2-with-elastic-security/blog-elastic-security-3.jpg)\n\nThe screenshot above shows in the investigation of the detection alert that Java executed a shell script to download and run a bash script.\n\n## Update: Detection & hunting improvements\n\n**Suspicious Shell Commands Execution via Java**\n\nBased on observed publicly known malicious Java classes served via log4j exploit, you can hunt for suspicious shell scripts and ingress tool transfer commands:\n\n```\nprocess where event.type == \"start\" and\n  process.parent.name : \"java*\" and\n\n  /* Ingress tools transfer via common shell command interpreters */\n\n  /* linux or macos */\n  (\n   (process.name : (\"sh\", \"bash\", \"python*\") and\n    process.command_line : (\"*curl*|*sh*\", \"*wget*|*bash\", \"*curl*|*bash*\", \"*curl*|*bash*\", \"*http*|*sh*\", \"*python*http*\")) or\n\n  /* windows */\n  (process.name : (\"powershell.exe\", \"pwsh.exe\", \"cmd.exe\") and\n   process.command_line : (\"*.downloadstring*\", \"*.downloadfile*\", \"*.downloaddata*\", \"*BitsTransfer*\", \"* -enc*\", \"* IEX*\", \"*wp-content*\", \"*wp-admin*\", \"*wp-includes*\", \"*$*$*$*$*$*\", \"*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*\", \"*.replace*\", \"*start-process*\", \"*http*\", \"*cmd*powershell*\")))\n```\n\n**Untrusted File Execution via JAVA**\n\nIdentifies when a JAVA interpreter creates an executable file (PE/ELF) and the file is subsequently executed.\n\n**Detection Rule when using Endpoint data**\n\n```\nsequence by host.id with maxspan=5m\n [ file where event.type != \"deletion\" and\n  process.name : (\"java\", \"java.exe\", \"javaw.exe\") and\n\n  (file.extension : (\"exe\", \"com\", \"pif\", \"scr\") or\n      /* Match Windows PE files by header data (MZ) */\n  file.Ext.header_bytes : (\"4d5a*\", \"7f454c46*\")) and\n\n  not file.path :  (\"?:\\\\Program Files\\\\*\",\n                    \"?:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\*\") ] by file.path\n [ process where event.type == \"start\" and\n  not process.code_signature.trusted == true ] by process.executable\n```\n\n**Detection rule when using Endgame streamed events**\n\n```\nsequence by agent.id with maxspan=5m\n  [ file where event.type != \"deletion\"\n    process.name : (\"java\", \"java.exe\", \"javaw.exe\")] by file_path\n  [ process where event.type == \"start\" and\n  not process.code_signature.trusted == true] by process_path\n```\n\n**Potential CoinMiner activity**\n\nProcess with command line common to cryptocurrency miner (most observed campaigns leveraging log4j exploit are coinminers):\n\n```\nprocess where event.type == \"start\" and\n process.command_line :\n       (\"* pool.*\", \"*-u*--coin*\", \"*.xmr.*\", \"*.xmr1.*\",\n        \"*stratum*\", \"*elitter.net*\", \"*cryptonight*\",\n        \"*-a scrypt*\", \"*stratum1*\", \"*-userpass*\", \"*-max-cpu-usage*\",\n\t  \"*qhor.net*\", \"*-wallet*pool*\", \"*--donate-level*\",

that analysts may leverage to identify if systems they are using have been exploited or are under active exploitation:\n\n- A series of [payloads](https://gist.github.com/nathanqthai/01808c569903f41a52e7e7b575caa890) have been shared by the [GreyNoise team](https://twitter.com/GreyNoiseIO/status/1469430126819618821), including payloads containing both encoded and decoded variants for analysts looking to explore logs stored within their systems. This has been complemented with a list of initial [tagged IPs](https://twitter.com/GreyNoiseIO/status/1469334738225741832) attempting exploitation of the vulnerability.\n\n- [Florian Roth of Nextron Systems](https://twitter.com/cyb3rops/status/1469243580929740802?s=21) has provided a [series of checks](https://gist.github.com/Neo23x0/e4c8b03ff8cdf1fa63b7d15db6e3860b) for local exploitation using grep / zgrep, alongside some initial YARA signatures in a Gist listed on his Github account. Florian also shared a method for generating [Thinkst](https://canarytokens.org/generate#) [CanaryTokens](https://twitter.com/cyb3rops/status/1469405846010572816) to test systems you may manage for exploitability.\n\n- [Rob Fuller (Mubix)](https://twitter.com/mubix) has shared a list of known file hashes for vulnerable versions of the framework, [here](https://github.com/mubix/CVE-2021-44228-Log4Shell-Hashes).\n\n## Additional Mitigation Strategies\n\nOutside of the recommended guidance from the Apache team regarding the deployment of the latest, patched versions of the Log4j2 framework to update, a number of mitigations have been widely suggested to prevent exploitation:\n\n- [Fastly](https://www.fastly.com/blog/digging-deeper-into-log4shell-0day-rce-exploit-found-in-log4j) have suggested checking if your version of Log4j supports executing the JVM with JAVA_OPTS=-Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true to disable the lookup functionality to the remote server. This should apply to versions 2.10.0 through 2.15.0.\n\n- To prevent lateral movement from a vulnerable host, or exploitation over the network, limiting connectivity from potentially vulnerable systems to external resources to trusted applications and / or services is recommended.\n\n## Thank you, from Elastic Security.\n\nWe want to thank all of the security teams across the globe for your tireless work today and through the weekend, especially those of you listed in this post.
